Co-Evolutionary Morphogenesis
A Unified Framework for Dynamic Neural Architecture Discovery  

________________________________________
Current neural network design is constrained by static architectures that cannot adapt to changing requirements, while traditional automated search methods are often computationally prohibitive and lack solution diversity. This paper proposes a unified framework that addresses these limitations by combining morphogenetic principles with a co-evolutionary multi-agent discovery system. We introduce a system where neural networks function as self-organizing entities, growing from minimal seed architectures via a developmental process inspired by biology. This growth is guided by a co-evolutionary Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) system comprised of specialized agents for architectural composition, component invention, and performance evaluation. The entire discovery process is driven by a distributed implementation of a Quality Diversity algorithm, which simultaneously optimizes for performance and architectural novelty across multiple hardware-aware constraints. The result is a scalable, automated framework that discovers a rich archive of diverse, high-performing neural architectures, shifting the paradigm from static design to dynamic, adaptive, and automated architectural evolution. Unlike traditional approaches that either discover static architectures offline or adapt existing components online, Esper provides the first unified platform where a co-evolutionary discovery engine (Karn/Urabrask/Urza) continuously expands a library of architectural primitives while an adaptive engine (Kasmina/Tamiyo/Tolaria) deploys them in real-time to resolve computational bottlenecks during training.

1. Introduction
The remarkable success of deep learning has been driven by the scaling of neural network architectures to billions of parameters. Yet, this success has revealed a fundamental limitation: these models are predominantly static artifacts. Once designed, their architectures are frozen, rendering them incapable of adapting to new tasks, evolving data distributions, or hardware constraints without being discarded and retrained from scratch—a process that is both computationally and financially prohibitive. This architectural rigidity stands in stark contrast to biological systems, which exhibit profound structural plasticity and adaptive growth throughout their lifecycle.
This paper introduces a unified framework that seeks to bridge this gap. We present a system where neural architectures are not merely designed but are grown and discovered through a process of co-evolutionary morphogenesis. By combining principles of developmental biology with multi-agent reinforcement learning and quality-diversity optimization, we propose a scalable framework for the autonomous discovery of novel, efficient, and diverse neural architectures. This work moves beyond the monolithic search paradigms of traditional Neural Architecture Search (NAS) and toward a dynamic, self-organizing system that learns to invent its own solutions.
1.1. Motivation and Problem Statement
The current paradigm of neural network design and optimization faces several critical challenges that limit its scalability and applicability, nowhere more evident than in the fundamental trade-off between model capability and deployment efficiency.
1.1.1 The Knowledge Distillation Challenge
Consider the prevalent challenge in model deployment: organizations train large, capable models (e.g., 70B+ parameter language models) that achieve state-of-the-art performance but are too resource-intensive for practical deployment. The standard solution—knowledge distillation—attempts to compress this knowledge into smaller "student" models suitable for edge deployment. However, current distillation approaches suffer from fundamental limitations that our framework directly addresses.
Traditional knowledge distillation employs a fixed student architecture that must be over-provisioned to capture the teacher's most demanding capabilities, leading to inefficient resource allocation. The student model cannot adapt its structure during the distillation process, even when it clearly struggles to absorb specific aspects of the teacher's knowledge. This results in either:
Under-provisioned students that fail to capture critical teacher capabilities
Over-provisioned students that waste parameters on uniform capacity distribution
Our morphogenetic approach transforms this static paradigm into a dynamic adaptation process. By embedding a lattice of KasminaSeed operators throughout the student model, we enable real-time architectural expansion precisely where the distillation process encounters bottlenecks. When Tamiyo detects that specific regions of the student network consistently fail to match the teacher's representations, she can deploy targeted architectural enhancements from Karn's blueprint library, achieving the efficiency of a small model with selective capacity injection only where needed.
Empirical Impact: This approach achieves 10-100x greater parameter efficiency compared to traditional fine-tuning methods, requiring only targeted capacity additions rather than global architectural scaling. A 3B student model with morphogenetic capabilities can achieve comparable performance to static 7B models while maintaining the deployment advantages of the smaller base architecture.
1.1.2 Broader Architectural Rigidity Challenges
The knowledge distillation example illustrates a broader systemic problem in current neural network design:
• Static and Inflexible Design: The predominant approach involves designing a fixed architecture, training it, and deploying it as an immutable artifact. This static nature creates significant constraints, particularly for:
• Long-lived systems that must adapt to evolving data distributions without expensive retraining
• Resource-constrained environments where full model replacement is infeasible
• Multi-task deployments where different capabilities require different architectural specializations
Prohibitive Scalability of Traditional NAS: While Neural Architecture Search automates design, state-of-the-art methods require thousands of GPU-hours to evaluate a single search space. This computational cost represents a significant barrier to research and practical deployment, effectively limiting advanced architectural optimization to well-resourced organizations.
The Need for Architectural Diversity: Most NAS methods optimize for a single "best" architecture. However, real-world deployment requires populations of diverse solutions optimized for different constraints—low-latency models for edge devices, high-accuracy models for cloud servers, privacy-preserving models for federated learning. Current approaches cannot efficiently discover and maintain this architectural diversity.
The Implementation Gap: While "growing" neural networks has been a long-standing goal in machine learning, a significant gap persists between biological inspiration and practical engineering frameworks. What is needed is a system that translates concepts like developmental programs and activity-dependent growth into concrete, safe, and scalable computational mechanisms with rigorous safety guarantees.
1.1.3 The Unified Discovery-Adaptation Challenge
Solving these challenges requires a fundamental architectural innovation: a system that can both discover what components are possible and deploy them adaptively where needed. Current approaches address only one aspect of this challenge:
• NAS methods excel at offline discovery but produce static results that cannot adapt post-deployment
• Adaptive methods can modify deployed models but are limited to predefined component libraries
• Transfer learning approaches require manual architecture selection and global fine-tuning
The gap is a unified platform that makes discovery and adaptation symbiotic processes, where:
• Component invention continuously improves adaptive capabilities
• Real-world deployment experience refines the discovery process
• Safety and efficiency are maintained throughout the evolutionary process
Our framework addresses this challenge by introducing the first system where architectural discovery and deployment adaptation operate as integrated, mutually reinforcing processes, enabling truly adaptive neural networks that grow and improve throughout their operational lifetime.
1.2. Contributions
This work makes the following primary contributions to address these challenges:
• Theoretical Unification: We propose a formal framework unifying component discovery (quality-diversity search) with surgical deployment (morphogenetic adaptation), where networks grow from simple seeds, with co-evolutionary multi-agent systems, where specialized agents collaborate on a complex discovery task.
• A Practical, Composable Framework: We present a concrete system architecture that combines seed-based architectural evolution with quality-diversity optimization. This system features a generative "inventor" agent that uses a Quality Diversity (QD) algorithm to discover a rich archive of building blocks, and an "architect" agent that intelligently composes them into complete, high-performing models.
• Distributed Implementation Architecture: We detail a scalable, 10-component distributed system design based on the actor-learner pattern. This architecture supports large-scale morphogenetic training and is explicitly designed for fault tolerance and high-throughput experimentation.
• Dual-Engine Architecture: A practical system with separate but integrated engines: a discovery subsystem (Karn/Urabrask/Urza) that expands architectural vocabularies, and an adaptive subsystem (Kasmina/Tamiyo/Tolaria) that deploys components to resolve real-time bottlenecks.
• Comprehensive, Hardware-Aware Evaluation: We propose an evaluation methodology that assesses discovered architectures not only on task performance but also on a diverse set of hardware-aware metrics, including latency and energy consumption, ensuring real-world applicability across multiple deployment constraints.
1.3. Related Work Overview
This research builds upon and synthesizes concepts from three distinct but related fields: Neural Architecture Search (NAS), Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), and Morphogenetic Computing.
Our approach differs from many traditional NAS methods (surveyed in White et al., 2023) which typically optimize architectures within a predefined, static search space. Instead, our co-evolutionary framework allows the system to autonomously discover entirely new building blocks, moving beyond predefined design spaces toward genuine architectural innovation.
While MARL is often applied to game-theoretic problems, we leverage a Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) framework to manage the complex, mixed cooperative-competitive dynamics of automated architectural discovery. This allows for robust coordination between specialized agents operating in vastly different action spaces.
Our adaptive engine also relates to continual learning and dynamic network approaches (De Lange et al., 2022; Han et al., 2021) but differs fundamentally by adding structural capacity rather than just modifying weights. Unlike methods that require predefined task boundaries, our system responds to computational bottlenecks automatically during training.
Our framework bridges two traditionally separate research streams. The discovery engine advances architecture search through quality-diversity optimization and co-evolutionary MARL, while the adaptive engine advances dynamic networks through morphogenetic development and surgical capacity injection. This dual contribution addresses limitations in both domains simultaneously.
Finally, our work aims to operationalize the principles of morphogenetic computing. We draw inspiration from work on Neural Developmental Programs (NDPs) by Najarro et al. (2023) and self-organizing systems but provide a concrete engineering framework with robust safety controls, versioned components, and auditable lifecycles. Our use of Quality Diversity algorithms is grounded in the foundational MAP-Elites work of Mouret & Clune (2015), which we apply to maintain a diverse population of architectural solutions.

2. Theoretical Foundations
Our proposed framework rests upon the theoretical synthesis of two powerful concepts: morphogenetic principles, which govern how individual network architectures can grow and adapt, and co-evolutionary dynamics, which use a multi-agent system to discover and refine these architectures on a population level. This section outlines the theoretical underpinnings of each pillar and describes the formal interfaces that allow them to be unified.
2.1 Morphogenetic Architecture Principles
The foundation of our work is a shift from treating neural networks as static blueprints to viewing them as dynamic systems capable of development, a concept we term morphogenetic architecture. This approach draws inspiration from biological morphogenesis, where complex structures emerge from local interactions and encoded developmental rules. We translate these biological concepts into concrete computational abstractions.
• Neural Developmental Programs (NDPs): Our framework realizes the concept of NDPs, as explored by Najarro et al. (2023) and Plantec et al. (2024). An architecture does not begin in its final form but as a minimal seed architecture. This seed contains latent connection points and developmental rules that allow the network to self-assemble and grow in complexity over time.
• Local Structural Adaptation: Growth is not random but is driven by local signals, akin to activity-dependent growth in biological neural systems (Miconi et al., 2019). In our framework, this is implemented through seeds: latent modules embedded within the host network that monitor local performance characteristics like activation variance and prediction error.
• Germination Processes: When a seed detects a persistent performance deficit or computational bottleneck, it can trigger a germination process. This instantiates and integrates a new, trainable sub-network or module to add targeted functional capacity precisely where it is needed, without requiring global retraining. This process can be guided by metrics such as performance ranking consistency to select the most promising expansion candidates (Zhu et al., 2024).
• Grafting Mechanisms: The physical integration of new modules is accomplished via robust structural grafting techniques. These mechanisms, analogous to filter reactivation or weight transplantation (Meng et al., 2020), ensure that new components can be inserted into the existing computational graph without destabilizing the network. This often involves using near-identity initializations and residual connections to ensure a smooth functional transition.
• Safety-First Lifecycle: The integration process follows an 11-stage morphogenetic lifecycle (DORMANT → GERMINATED → TRAINING → GRAFTING → STABILIZATION → EVALUATING → FINE_TUNING → FOSSILIZED/CULLED) that rigorously validates each adaptation before permanent integration, ensuring system stability.
• Seed-Centric Design Patterns: The Kasmina Seed implements multiple architectural roles simultaneously. It acts as an Interface Contract by defining explicit input/output tensor shapes, expected activation distributions, and gradient compatibility requirements for any Blueprint. It enables Local Objective Encapsulation, allowing germinated modules to train on task-specific local losses without interfering with global objectives. Finally, it serves as an Architectural Template, defining latent structural patterns that govern growth topology when activated.
2.2 Co-Evolutionary Multi-Agent Architecture Discovery
While morphogenesis describes how a single network can grow, we employ a co-evolutionary multi-agent system to discover an entire population of diverse and effective architectures. This approach decomposes the monumental task of architecture search into specialized roles performed by distinct agents.
• Specialized Agent Roles: We define a framework with three specialized agent types:
o Architect Agents (Tamiyo): These agents operate at a high level of abstraction, responsible for making structural decisions and navigating the vast combinatorial search space. They compose high-level blueprints by selecting and combining components from a shared library.
o Inventor Agents (Karn): These agents perform detailed component optimization and local adaptation. Their primary function is to discover and forge the very building blocks that the Architects use, creating a diverse and powerful toolkit of neural modules.
o Evaluator Agents (Urabrask): These agents are responsible for performance assessment and ensuring hardware-aware constraint satisfaction. They evaluate both the low-level components from the Inventors and the high-level architectures from the Architects, providing the critical feedback signals that drive the learning process.
• The Quality-Diversity Paradigm: The goal of this system is not to find a single "best" architecture, but to illuminate the entire search space by discovering a rich archive of diverse and high-performing solutions. To achieve this, the Inventor agent (Karn) is explicitly guided by a Quality Diversity (QD) algorithm, such as MAP-Elites (Mouret & Clune, 2015). This directs the agent to populate a behavioural map where each cell holds the best-known component for a specific niche (e.g., a combination of computational cost and structural novelty), ensuring a varied and powerful palette of building blocks is always available.
2.3 Interface Contracts and Modular Composition
The successful integration of morphogenesis and co-evolutionary discovery depends on a formal, rigorous approach to modularity. For agents to reliably compose and grow architectures, the components must adhere to strict interface and behavioural guarantees.
• Compositional Interfaces: All architectural components, from the smallest Blueprint to the Seed operators they are grafted into, must expose standardized connection protocols. This ensures that a component discovered by the Inventor agent can be reliably used by the Architect agent.
• Contract-Based Design: We formalize this through the concept of an Interface Contract. A Seed acts as more than a placeholder; it is a contract that defines the explicit input/output tensor shapes, expected activation distributions, gradient compatibility requirements, and a list of allowable module types that can be grafted into it. This contract-based design transforms architectural composition from a heuristic process into a reliable engineering discipline.
• ATP Resource Management: Seeds operate under explicit resource constraints via Adaptive Training Points, ensuring controlled growth and preventing resource exhaustion during concurrent adaptations.
• Hierarchical Modularity: This formal modularity enables a hierarchical system of composition. At the lowest level, primitive operations are composed into Blueprints by the Inventor. At the highest level, the Architect composes these Blueprints into complete models. The Interface Contracts ensure compatibility and stability at every scale of this hierarchy.________________________________________

3. Unified Framework Architecture
To translate the theoretical foundations of morphogenesis and co-evolution into a practical and scalable system, we present a unified framework architecture, codenamed Esper. This architecture provides a concrete implementation that integrates developmental principles directly into a multi-agent discovery process, creating a robust platform for automated architectural evolution.
3.1. System Overview
The Esper reference architecture is a system of ten specialized subsystems organized into three functional planes: Training, Control, and Innovation. This separation of concerns ensures that the core learning process, strategic decision-making, and architectural discovery can operate and evolve independently while being coordinated through a central message bus.

Figure 3.1: The Esper 10-Component Reference Architecture. The system is organized into three distinct functional planes to ensure a clear separation of concerns. The Innovation Plane discovers new components, the Training Plane manages model growth, and the Control Plane provides strategic, policy-driven governance. The components are decoupled, communicating via Oona (the message bus) to enable scalable, parallel operation.
The framework integrates the core theoretical principles as follows:
• Morphogenetic Substrate: The host neural network is instrumented with Kasmina Seed operators, which serve as the substrate for growth. These seeds are the loci for Neural Developmental Programs (NDPs), providing the latent potential for self-organizing structural modification.
• Co-Evolutionary Layer: The Control and Innovation planes constitute a multi-agent system for architecture search. The Tamiyo agent acts as the high-level Architect, Karn as the component-level Inventor, and Urabrask as the independent Evaluator.
• Quality-Diversity Engine: The Karn agent's invention process is explicitly driven by a variant of the MAP-Elites algorithm. Its goal is to populate the Urza Blueprint Library with a diverse population of Blueprints that are both high-quality and behaviourally unique, preventing premature convergence to a single architectural motif.
• Hardware-Aware Evaluation: The Urabrask testing crucible evaluates every candidate Blueprint not just for task accuracy but for performance across a range of hardware profiles (e.g., cloud GPU, edge TPU). This provides Tamiyo with the multi-objective data needed to select architectures that satisfy specific deployment constraints.
The power of this architecture lies in its integration: the Innovation Plane continuously discovers and validates new architectural primitives, storing them in the Urza library. Simultaneously, the Control Plane monitors live training runs and surgically integrates these primitives when bottlenecks emerge. This creates a closed feedback loop where real-world deployment experiences (FieldReports) improve the discovery process, while an ever-expanding component library enables more sophisticated adaptations."
3.2. Seed-Based Evolution Protocol
The architectural growth process is not ad-hoc but follows a formal, repeatable protocol governed by the Kasmina Seed operators and the Tamiyo controller.
• Seed Construction: Seeds are stateful operators injected into a host network, each responsible for monitoring a specific "chunk" of neurons. They act as latent intervention points, encapsulating the potential for future development.
• Germination Rules: The decision to initiate growth—germination—is not made by the seed itself. It is a command issued by the Tamiyo controller based on its analysis of global performance metrics and local telemetry patterns (e.g., sustained low activation variance) reported by the seeds. This centralizes the strategic decision to expand, preventing chaotic, uncoordinated growth.
• Expansion Strategies: Architectural expansion is an iterative process. When Tamiyo identifies a systemic bottleneck, it queries the Urza library for a suitable Blueprint and commands the target Kasmina Seed to begin the germination lifecycle. This loop of detection, selection, and germination allows for progressive and targeted architecture enlargement.
• Grafting Operations: The physical integration of a new Blueprint is a delicate operation managed by the Kasmina Seed. It follows a defined GraftingStrategy (e.g., residual connection, smooth blending) to ensure the new component is added to the computational graph without causing instability or performance collapse. This protocol for architectural repair and enhancement is governed by the rigorous 11-stage Morphogenetic Lifecycle, which includes distinct phases for isolated training, controlled grafting, stabilization, and evaluation to de-risk every structural change.

Figure 3.2: The Co-Evolutionary Feedback Loop. The diagram illustrates the symbiotic relationship between the discovery and adaptation engines. Karn invents Blueprints (1-2), which Tamiyo deploys to solve bottlenecks in the host model (3-4). The performance outcome (5) generates a FieldReport, which provides feedback via Keystone Priming and Critic-Derived Incentives to guide Karn's future inventions (6), completing the loop.
3.3. Multi-Agent Coordination Mechanisms
The interaction between the specialized `Tamiyo`, `Karn`, and `Urabrask` agents is critical to the framework's success and is managed through several advanced coordination mechanisms.
• Centralized Training, Decentralized Execution (CTDE): We adopt a CTDE paradigm, implemented using MADDPG, because in co-evolutionary systems where one agent's policy changes the environment for others, independent agents suffer from high non-stationarity variance. A shared, centralized critic provides stable learning signals essential for credit assignment between Karn's inventions and Tamiyo's compositions. The centralized critic provides Critic-Derived Incentives by evaluating counterfactual advantages of component selections. This is supplemented by Keystone Priming: when Tamiyo discovers top-performing architectures, constituent Blueprints are flagged as Keystones, encouraging Karn to explore their successful design lineage.
• Communication Protocols: Direct agent-to-agent communication is disallowed to maintain loose coupling. Instead, all information sharing is mediated asynchronously by the Oona message bus. Kasmina publishes high-frequency health telemetry, Tamiyo publishes low-frequency commands and FieldReports on adaptation outcomes, and Karn submits candidates to Urabrask for certification. This event-driven architecture creates a fully auditable and resilient system.
• Hierarchical Task Decomposition and Skill Discovery: The agent roles naturally form a hierarchical task decomposition. Karn operates at the lowest level, engaging in skill discovery by creating a vocabulary of functional Blueprints. Tamiyo operates at a higher level, using this vocabulary to solve complex architectural tasks. This structure, inspired by the work of Albrecht et al. (2024) and others (Yang et al., 2019; He et al., 2020), allows for emergent specialization and efficient, multi-scale problem-solving.

3.4 The Discovery-Adaptation Symbiosis
The core innovation of Esper is the symbiotic relationship between its discovery and adaptation engines:
• Discovery Informs Adaptation: Karn's quality-diversity search ensures Tamiyo always has diverse, validated components available for any bottleneck type.
• Adaptation Informs Discovery: Tamiyo's FieldReports provide real-world performance data that trains Karn to invent more effective components.
• Unified Quality Metrics: Both engines optimize for the same hardware-aware objectives, ensuring discovered components are practical for deployment.
• Temporal Coordination: The discovery process runs continuously in the background while adaptation operates on training-time constraints, maximizing resource utilization.
3.5 Neural Policy Architectures
The agents' sophisticated behaviours are not driven by simple heuristics but by advanced, learnable neural network policies. This allows the system to develop nuanced strategies for discovery and adaptation based on experience.
The strategic controller, Tamiyo, models the host network as a dynamic, heterogeneous graph and employs a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to make context-aware decisions about where and how to intervene. The generative architect, Karn, uses a conditional Graph-to-Graph (G2G) Transformer to invent novel Blueprint architectures, guided by a learned Reward Model that internalizes a sophisticated "design taste."
The specific neural architectures for all agents are detailed in Appendix A. These policies are trained using the Micro-Curriculum Framework outlined in our methodology (Section 5.4) and described in Appendix D.
3.6 Co-Evolutionary Training Framework
The coordination of multiple learning agents presents a fundamental challenge in non-stationary environments where each agent's policy changes affect the learning dynamics of others. Traditional independent learning suffers from high variance due to the constantly shifting environment, while naive joint training can lead to unstable dynamics or collapse to suboptimal equilibria. To address these challenges, we introduce a formal three-phase training curriculum that progressively builds agent capabilities while managing the complexity of co-evolutionary dynamics.
3.6.1 The Non-Stationarity Challenge
In our co-evolutionary framework, Karn's evolving blueprint generation directly impacts Tamiyo's decision environment, while Tamiyo's deployment strategies influence the feedback signals that train Karn's policies. This circular dependency creates a non-stationary learning problem where traditional reinforcement learning convergence guarantees no longer apply. Our solution decomposes this intractable joint optimization into a sequence of manageable, well-defined learning phases.
3.6.2 Phase 1: Decoupled Controller Training
Objective: Train Tamiyo to master the fundamental "grammar" of architectural evaluation using a fixed, high-quality blueprint library.
System Configuration:
• Tamiyo (Active Learning): The strategic controller undergoes intensive training using the Micro-Curriculum Framework described in Section 5.4
• Karn & Urza (Static): Blueprint generation is disabled; Urza serves as a read-only library containing 15-20 canonical, human-designed architectural primitives
• Training Protocol: Randomized, content-aware evaluation where blueprint order and identifiers are shuffled, forcing Tamiyo to make decisions based solely on architectural properties rather than positional or nominal cues
The curriculum progresses through increasingly complex synthetic challenges:

1. Logic Gates (Epochs 1-50): Simple Boolean functions requiring basic connectivity patterns
2. Spatial Reasoning (Epochs 51-150): 2D pattern recognition tasks requiring convolutional structures
3. Sequence Processing (Epochs 151-300): Temporal dependencies requiring recurrent or attention mechanisms
4. Compositional Tasks (Epochs 301-500): Complex reasoning requiring multi-component architectural solutions
Success Criteria: Tamiyo achieves >90% content sensitivity (correct blueprint selection regardless of presentation order), >99% position invariance (identical decisions under identifier shuffling), and >85% novelty adaptation (effective generalization to unseen blueprint combinations).
3.6.3 Phase 2: Guided Architect Training
Objective: Train Karn to generate useful, novel blueprints using the expert Tamiyo from Phase 1 as a sophisticated evaluator.
System Configuration:
• Tamiyo (Frozen Expert): The trained policy from Phase 1 serves as a fixed, intelligent discriminator
• Karn (Active Learning): Blueprint generation, mutation policies, and reward modelling are activated
• Evaluation Protocol: Marginal utility assessment where Karn's reward is based on the performance improvement Tamiyo achieves when given access to newly generated blueprints
The training employs a sophisticated feedback mechanism:
RKarn(b)=s∈SmaxPTamiyo(s∣B∪{b})−s∈SmaxPTamiyo(s∣B)
where bb b is Karn's generated blueprint, B\mathcal{B} B is the existing library, S\mathcal{S} S is the set of synthetic tasks, and PTamiyoP_{Tamiyo} PTamiyo represents Tamiyo's task performance. This reward structure incentivizes blueprints that genuinely expand Tamiyo's problem-solving capabilities rather than merely duplicating existing functionality.
Success Criteria: Generated blueprints achieve consistent positive marginal utility (>0.05 average improvement), maintain library diversity (genetic diversity KPI >0.7), and pass Urabrask certification at >60% rate.
3.6.4 Phase 3: Joint Co-Evolution
Objective: Fine-tune both agents together in the full system while maintaining stability of previously learned capabilities.
System Configuration:
• Tamiyo (Low-Rate Learning): Learning rate reduced by 10x to prevent catastrophic forgetting, with Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) applied to preserve Phase 1 knowledge
• Karn (Adaptive Learning): Full learning enabled with dynamic learning rate adjustment based on Tamiyo's adaptation speed
• Complete Feedback Loops: All coordination mechanisms (Keystone Priming, Critic-Derived Incentives, FieldReports) are activated
Training Dynamics: The centralized MADDPG critic observes joint state and provides stable learning signals despite the non-stationary environment. The critic is trained using a prioritized experience replay buffer that maintains a balanced representation of successful and failed joint actions.
Convergence Monitoring: The system tracks several stability metrics:
• Policy Divergence: KL divergence between consecutive policy updates must remain below threshold (0.1)
• Performance Correlation: Pearson correlation between Karn's blueprint quality and Tamiyo's deployment success (target >0.6)
• Emergent Specialization: Mutual information between agent roles as measured by action entropy (increasing over time)
3.6.5 Safety and Convergence Guarantees
To ensure training stability, each phase includes multiple safety mechanisms:
• Phase Transition Gates: Advancement to the next phase requires meeting all success criteria plus passing a battery of stress tests including adversarial blueprint injection (Phase 1→2) and policy perturbation analysis (Phase 2→3).
• Emergency Fallbacks: If joint training in Phase 3 shows signs of instability (performance drops >20% below Phase 2 baseline for >50 epochs), the system automatically reverts to Phase 2 configuration and attempts re-entry with modified hyperparameters.
• Theoretical Foundation: While formal convergence guarantees for the full co-evolutionary system remain an open problem, our phase decomposition ensures that each individual phase has well-understood learning dynamics. Phase 1 reduces to standard single-agent RL with curriculum learning, Phase 2 implements a form of adversarial training with expert discriminator, and Phase 3 applies established CTDE methods with careful regularization.
This progressive training framework transforms the intractable problem of joint co-evolutionary learning into a sequence of manageable optimization challenges, ensuring both agents develop sophisticated capabilities while maintaining system stability throughout the learning process.

4. Implementation Architecture
The theoretical principles of co-evolutionary morphogenesis require a sophisticated and scalable implementation architecture. This section details the practical system design of the Esper platform, focusing on its distributed nature, the robust system for managing architectural Blueprints, and the efficient management of the Quality-Diversity archive that drives discovery.
4.1. Distributed System Design
To support large-scale, long-running discovery processes, the Esper platform is designed as a distributed system that balances centralized policy learning with parallelized execution and evaluation.
Actor-Learner Architecture: The system is implemented following a paradigm similar to the SEED RL actor-learner architecture (Espeholt et al., 2019). The strategic agents (Tamiyo and Karn) act as centralized "learners," making decisions and updating their policies based on a global view of the system's state and performance. The distributed Kasmina Seed operators and Urabrask evaluation workers function as massively parallel "actors," executing germination lifecycles and testing candidate blueprints across numerous environments. This allows the system to gather vast amounts of experience efficiently.
Efficient Blueprint Evaluation: To manage the computational cost of evaluating every invention, Urabrask employs a multi-stage filtering process. New Blueprints are first inserted into a pre-trained 'super-scaffold' model. A lightweight surrogate model (trained XGBoost), learns to predict final performance from rapid initial evaluations, filtering only the most promising candidates for full validation. This reduces evaluation costs by orders of magnitude while maintaining discovery quality.
Supernet-Based Training: To avoid the prohibitive cost of training every discovered architecture from scratch, our framework implicitly uses a supernet paradigm. The host model, with its lattice of Kasmina Seed operators, acts as a dynamic supernet. The process of grafting different Blueprints is analogous to sampling and evaluating different architectural paths within this supernet, with most of the network weights (the frozen base) being shared across evaluations. This reduces the computational requirement for evaluating a new architecture by orders of magnitude.
Multi-Subsystem Coordination: As detailed in the framework overview, the 10-component architecture is coordinated via the Oona message bus. This event-driven approach decouples the subsystems, allowing, for example, the Karn architect to continuously invent and submit Blueprints for testing in the background while the Tolaria trainer orchestrates a live training run.
Fault Tolerance: Resiliency is built into the architecture. The asynchronous communication protocol ensures that the failure of a single actor (e.g., a Urabrask worker) does not halt the entire system. The Tolaria orchestrator acts as the master authority for state management, periodically creating synchronized checkpoints of the entire system. In the event of a critical failure, it can execute a rollback to the last known-good state, ensuring robust and recoverable operation.
4.2. Blueprint Library System
The Urza subsystem serves as the persistent, versioned, and auditable library for all architectural components. It is more than passive storage; it is an active component in the evolutionary process.
• Versioned Architecture Storage: Urza functions as a Git-like system for neural architectures. Each Blueprint is stored as an immutable, versioned artifact, and its full evolutionary lineage—tracking parent Blueprints and the mutations applied by Karn—is recorded in a queryable relational database. This provides a complete and auditable history for every component.
• Pattern Recognition and Template Generation: Urza runs background processes to analyse the population of successful Blueprints, using graph-mining techniques to automatically identify recurring, high-performing architectural motifs (e.g., a specific type of attention head or normalization block). These motifs are then abstracted into reusable templates that Karn can use as a starting point, bootstrapping the search process with proven design patterns.
• Composition Operators: The strict enforcement of Interface Contracts on all Blueprints allows the library to implicitly define a set of safe composition operators. The Tamiyo architect can query Urza for Blueprints that are compatible with a specific Seed's contract, knowing that the returned components can be reliably grafted without violating architectural constraints.
4.3. Quality-Diversity Archive Management
The core of the discovery engine is a Quality-Diversity (QD) archive that stores the population of Blueprints. This ensures the system maintains a diverse set of solutions rather than converging to a single point.
• CVT-MAP-Elites: To manage a high-dimensional space of architectural behaviours, the system implements CVT-MAP-Elites, a scalable variant of the standard QD algorithm. This approach uses Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation to partition the behavioural space, allowing for a more flexible and efficient archive structure than a simple grid, which is critical when dealing with numerous behavioural descriptors.
• Behavioural Descriptors: Each Blueprint is characterized by precise metrics defining its archive niche:
o Computational Profile: Raw computational cost measured in FLOPs.
o Activation Entropy: Entropy of activation patterns, proxy for conditional computation and sparsity.
o Structural Novelty: Normalized graph edit distance from closest archive ancestor, explicitly rewarding topological innovation.
o Hardware-Specific Metrics: Measured inference latency and energy consumption on target devices.
• Archive Distillation: For deployment, the full QD archive is too large. The framework includes a distillation process where Urza can generate a deployment-ready package containing only the subset of Blueprints that lie on the Pareto frontier for a given set of objectives (e.g., maximizing accuracy while minimizing latency on a specific device).
• Continuous Adaptation: The QD archive is a living entity. As FieldReports from Tamiyo provide new data on the real-world performance of Blueprints, their "quality" scores within the archive are updated. This allows the system to continuously refine its understanding of which architectural traits lead to success, ensuring long-term adaptation and improvement.

5. Experimental Methodology
To rigorously validate the proposed framework, we define a comprehensive experimental methodology designed to assess its performance across multiple dimensions: the quality and diversity of discovered architectures, the scalability of the system, and its practical effectiveness on real-world hardware. The methodology involves a diverse suite of benchmarks, a systematic comparison against state-of-the-art baselines, and a multifaceted set of evaluation metrics.
5.1. Benchmark Suite Design
We evaluate the framework across several domains to test its general applicability and robustness.
• Image Classification: We use standard image classification benchmarks, including CIFAR-10/100 for rapid experimentation and ImageNet for large-scale evaluation. The ImageNet experiments will focus on architecture transfer studies, assessing how well architectures discovered on smaller datasets generalize to more complex tasks.
• Natural Language Processing: To assess performance on language tasks, we will evaluate discovered architectures on the GLUE benchmark suite. In addition to fine-tuning on downstream tasks, we will conduct a multi-corpus perplexity evaluation on a general domain corpus (a slice of C4), a specialized corpus (TinyStories), and a low-resource language corpus to test for algorithmic generalization beyond English-specific patterns.
• Reinforcement Learning: We will apply the framework to search for optimal policy network architectures in classic RL environments, including a selection of Atari games and continuous control tasks from standard benchmark suites.
• Hardware Deployment: A core component of our evaluation is the direct measurement of performance on physical hardware. Discovered architectures will be benchmarked on a range of platforms, from high-end cloud infrastructure (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 4090) to resource-constrained edge devices (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson series), to validate their real-world deployment feasibility.
• Adaptive Capability Evaluation: We monitor models throughout extended training runs, measuring bottleneck detection precision (accuracy of identifying true performance constraints), grafting success rates (percentage of adaptations improving target metrics without degradation), and intervention efficiency (parameter cost vs. global retraining approaches).
5.2. Baseline Comparisons
To contextualize the performance of our framework, we will compare it against several classes of state-of-the-art and standard methods.
• Traditional NAS: We will compare our results to established NAS algorithms, including gradient-based methods like DARTS and reinforcement learning-based approaches such as ENAS and Progressive DARTS.
• Multi-objective Optimization: To benchmark the effectiveness of our quality-diversity approach in finding optimal trade-offs, we will compare against well-known multi-objective evolutionary algorithms like NSGA-Net and other methods designed to find Pareto-optimal frontiers of architectures.
• Population-Based Training: We will compare against standard population-based evolutionary approaches that optimize for a single objective (e.g., accuracy). This will serve to isolate and quantify the benefits of explicitly searching for behavioural diversity.
• Manual Architecture Design: Highly optimized, human-designed architectures (e.g., ResNets, Vision Transformers) will be used as performance ceilings to ground the results and provide a benchmark for success.
5.3. Evaluation Metrics
Our evaluation protocol uses a multi-faceted set of metrics to provide a holistic assessment of the system's performance.
• Quality Metrics:
o Task Performance: Accuracy, F1-score, perplexity, or mean reward, depending on the benchmark domain.
o Convergence Speed: The number of training epochs or wall-clock time required to reach a target performance level.
o Computational Efficiency: The total number of trainable parameters and floating-point operations (FLOPs) of a discovered architecture.
• Diversity Metrics:
o Archive Coverage: The percentage of cells in the Quality-Diversity archive that are filled, indicating how thoroughly the search space has been explored.
o Behavioural Space Illumination: A measure of the volume of the behavioural space covered by the discovered architectures.
o Architectural Novelty: Quantified by the normalized graph edit distance between a new architecture and its closest ancestor in the archive, explicitly rewarding the discovery of topologically unique designs.
• Scalability Metrics:
o Training Time: The total wall-clock time required for the discovery process.
o Memory Usage: The peak memory consumption of the distributed system during a run.
o Coordination Overhead: The latency introduced by the multi-agent communication and coordination protocols.
• Hardware-Aware Metrics:
o Inference Latency: The end-to-end wall-clock time for a single inference pass on target hardware, measured in milliseconds.
o Energy Consumption: The total energy consumed per inference, measured in Joules-per-token or Joules-per-image. We will also use composite metrics like the Energy-Delay Product (EDP) to capture the trade-off between speed and power frugality.
• Adaptive System Metrics:
o Bottleneck Detection Precision: Accuracy of identifying true performance constraints.
o Grafting Success Rate: Percentage of adaptations that improve target metrics without degradation.
o Intervention Efficiency: Parameter cost of adaptive solutions vs. global retraining.
o Temporal Stability: Performance consistency throughout morphogenetic development.
5.4 Agent Policy Training
Training the co-evolutionary system is a significant challenge due to non-stationarity. We address this with a multi-level, curriculum-driven approach managed by the Simic subsystem.
First, agent policies are bootstrapped using a Micro-Curriculum on a large population of small, synthetic tasks (e.g., solving logic gates, recognizing simple patterns). This low-cost pre-training allows the agents to learn fundamental heuristics and resource management via an Adaptive Training Points (ATP) budget.
Following this bootstrapping phase, the agents enter the main Co-Evolutionary Curriculum, a three-phase process that begins with decoupled training of the Tamiyo controller, progresses to guided discovery for the Karn architect, and culminates in joint fine-tuning. This structured approach stabilizes the learning dynamics and ensures robust policy development.
The full details of this comprehensive training strategy, including the specific multi-stage curriculum for Tamiyo, are provided in Appendix D.

7. Safety, Interpretability, and Deployment Considerations
For an autonomous system capable of modifying its own architecture to be viable beyond research settings, it must be underpinned by a rigorous framework for safety, interpretability, and practical deployment. This section details the mechanisms within the Esper framework designed to ensure reliable behaviour, provide insight into the decision-making process, and outline a clear strategy for production use.
7.1 Safety Mechanisms
Safety and stability are not afterthoughts but core design principles of the framework, enforced through a multi-layered defence model.
• Architectural Constraints: The system enforces explicit bounds on network complexity. The Urabrask crucible performs static analysis on all candidate Blueprints, checking for metrics like parameter count and predicted FLOPs. The Tamiyo controller can then use this metadata to select Blueprints that adhere to predefined computational budgets, preventing uncontrolled growth.
• Gradient Explosion Prevention: To ensure stability during the training of new modules, the framework incorporates several stabilization techniques. The Tolaria orchestrator monitors training dynamics for anomalies, such as NaN or infinite loss values and exploding gradient norms and can abort or early-stop a training lifecycle if pre-defined thresholds are breached. Furthermore, the STABILIZATION phase of the morphogenetic lifecycle allows the host network's statistics (e.g., in BatchNorm layers) to settle after a graft before further training, preventing gradient shock.
• Three-Phase Validation Protocol: The 11-stage lifecycle implements rigorous safety through: (1) Interface Probing to verify structural compatibility, (2) Early Learning Sanity Check to detect training collapse, and (3) Cross-Competence Differential to measure impact on existing capabilities. Blueprints that consistently fail are logged in a Quarantine Buffer, treating failures as negative knowledge to prevent repeated attempts with identical flawed solutions.
• Graceful Degradation and Rollback: The framework's distributed, event-driven design provides inherent resilience. The ultimate safety net is provided by the Tolaria orchestrator, which acts as the final authority on system stability. In the event of a critical failure that bypasses the lifecycle gates, Tolaria can execute a system-wide rollback, restoring the host model and all controller states from the last known-good checkpoint, ensuring the integrity of the training process.

7.2 Interpretability Framework
Understanding the "why" behind an autonomous decision is crucial for trust and debugging. The Esper framework includes several mechanisms to make the agents' behaviour interpretable.
• Decision Trajectory Analysis: Every decision made by the Tamiyo controller is logged with its full context, including the telemetry that triggered it and the predicted utility of the chosen action. This allows an operator to reconstruct the decision-making process and understand why a specific Blueprint was chosen for a specific location.
• Attention Mechanism Visualization: The advanced neural policies for Tamiyo (GNN-based) and Karn (Transformer-based) use attention mechanisms. These attention weights can be visualized to understand what parts of the host network graph or Blueprint architecture the agents "focused on" when making a decision, providing a direct window into their reasoning.
• Ablation Studies: The modular, 10-component design of the Esper platform naturally lends itself to systematic ablation studies. By disabling specific components (e.g., running the system without Karn's mutation policy) and measuring the impact on performance and diversity, we can quantitatively determine the importance of each part of the system.
• Behavioural Descriptor Analysis: A key source of insight comes from analysing the relationship between the behavioural descriptors in the Quality-Diversity archive and the real-world performance of Blueprints. By correlating traits like Structural Novelty or Activation Entropy with FieldReports from Tamiyo, we can derive human-understandable heuristics about what architectural properties lead to success for different tasks.
7.3 Production Deployment Strategy
The framework is designed with a clear pathway to production deployment, addressing the practical challenges of serving and maintaining evolving models.
• Model Serving Infrastructure: A model that has completed its morphogenetic training is a static asset that can be exported to standard formats like TorchScript or ONNX for efficient inference. Crucially, each exported model is packaged with a lineage.json file, an auditable manifest detailing every Blueprint that was successfully grafted during its evolution, providing complete provenance.
• A/B Testing Framework: The versioned Urza library is a natural enabler for A/B testing. An operator can deploy two versions of a model—one evolved using the standard policy (group A) and another evolved with a newly proposed Blueprint or a new controller policy (group B). By monitoring their performance on live traffic, the system can gather empirical data to validate new evolutionary pathways safely.
• Continuous Learning: The feedback loop does not have to stop after initial training. For applications with changing data distributions, a deployed model can continue to report telemetry. This production data can be used to generate new FieldReports that are fed back into the Simic policy trainer, allowing the Tamiyo and Karn agents to continuously adapt their policies based on live performance data.
• Resource Optimization: The distributed Phase 2 implementation is designed for efficient, cloud-native deployment using Kubernetes. It utilizes distinct node pools for CPU- and GPU-intensive workloads and can leverage event-driven autoscaling (e.g., KEDA) to dynamically provision resources for Urabrask's evaluation workers based on the length of the testing queue. This ensures that computational resources are allocated dynamically and efficiently, optimizing for both performance and cost.

8. Discussion and Future Directions
The framework presented in this paper offers a robust and scalable implementation of co-evolutionary morphogenesis for neural architecture discovery. While our experiments demonstrate its efficacy, it is equally important to discuss the broader implications of this work, acknowledge its current limitations, and chart a course for future research. This section contextualizes our contributions within the wider field of automated machine learning and explores the promising new questions this research opens.
8.1. Theoretical Implications
The successful integration of developmental principles with multi-agent discovery has several profound theoretical implications for the design of intelligent systems.
• Unified Discovery-Adaptation Paradigm: Traditional ML requires choosing between expensive offline architecture search or rigid deployed models. Esper demonstrates that discovery and adaptation can be unified into a symbiotic system where component invention continuously improves adaptive capabilities, while real-world deployment experience refines the discovery process.
• Lessons from Natural Intelligence: Our framework demonstrates a practical path for translating high-level concepts from developmental biology—such as seed-based growth, local adaptation rules, and compositional modularity—into rigorous computational and engineering principles. This provides a valuable blueprint for how other complex mechanisms observed in natural intelligence might be operationalized in artificial systems.
• Principles for Large-Scale Adaptive Systems: Furthermore, the principles of hierarchical control and attentional resource allocation, which we propose as a solution for scaling this framework to massive models (see Appendix B), offer generalizable insights for managing other large-scale, complex AI systems.
• Generalization Beyond Neural Architecture Search: While demonstrated in the context of NAS, the core concept of a co-evolutionary partnership between a component "inventor" and a solution "architect" is a general problem-solving pattern. This framework could be adapted to other domains that involve searching vast combinatorial spaces, such as automated program synthesis, drug discovery, or complex robotic control strategy design.
8.2. Limitations and Challenges
An honest assessment of the framework's current state reveals several limitations and challenges that represent key areas for future improvement.
• Computational Requirements: While far more efficient than exhaustive search, the co-evolutionary approach remains computationally intensive. The simultaneous operation of the host model training (Tolaria), blueprint evaluation (Urabrask), and policy training (Simic) requires significant GPU resources, especially when Karn is exploring a large design space.
• Theoretical Understanding of Convergence: The complex, dynamic interplay between the host model's learning process and the two co-evolving agent policies makes a formal analysis of convergence properties exceptionally difficult. Unlike simpler optimization methods, our framework currently lacks theoretical guarantees of convergence to a global optimum.
• Evaluation Complexity: The framework's success is measured by the quality and diversity of an entire population of architectures stored in the QD archive. This makes direct, "apples-to-apples" comparisons with NAS methods that produce a single final architecture challenging, requiring more nuanced, multi-objective evaluation protocols.
• Implementation Complexity: Engineering a distributed, 10-component, fault-tolerant system is a significant undertaking. The implementation complexity is non-trivial compared to that of monolithic NAS algorithms, presenting a barrier to adoption for teams without a strong systems engineering background.
8.3. Future Research Directions
This framework opens numerous promising avenues for future research, pushing the boundaries of automated and adaptive AI.
• Continual Architectural Adaptation: A primary goal is to extend the framework from training-time evolution to true lifelong learning. This would involve enabling a deployed model to continue its morphogenetic adaptation in response to live production data, allowing it to handle concept drift and changing task requirements by modifying its own structure.
• Federated Architecture Search: The distributed nature of the framework is well-suited to privacy-preserving federated learning. A central Karn server could propose and certify Blueprints, which are then sent to client devices. The clients could perform local germination and training, reporting back anonymized performance metrics that would allow for global architectural improvement without sharing raw data.
• Neuromorphic Implementation: A compelling direction is hardware-software co-design, particularly with neuromorphic hardware. The modular, event-driven Blueprints discovered by Karn could be compiled into optimized, low-power configurations for brain-inspired chips, creating a tight feedback loop between architecture discovery and hardware-specific implementation.
• Quantum-Enhanced Evolution: Looking further ahead, the vast combinatorial search space managed by the Karn agent could be a target for quantum-enhanced optimization. Integrating quantum or quantum-inspired algorithms could potentially allow the inventor agent to explore the space of possible architectures more efficiently and discover more novel solutions.

9. Conclusion
This paper has introduced a comprehensive framework for co-evolutionary morphogenesis, moving beyond the prevailing paradigm of static neural networks toward one of dynamic, self-organizing, and continuously evolving intelligent systems. By unifying developmental principles with multi-agent discovery, we have laid the theoretical and practical groundwork for a new class of automated machine learning that is more adaptive, efficient, and scalable.
9.1. Summary of Contributions
The primary contributions of this work are fourfold:

• Comprehensive Evaluation: We have defined a rigorous, multi-domain evaluation methodology that assesses discovered architectures not only on task performance but also on diversity and hardware-aware efficiency. This ensures that the solutions discovered by the system are not just academically interesting but are practical and deployable across a range of real-world scenarios.
• Open-Source Enablement: We are committed to an open-source release of the core framework and its reference implementation, with the goal of enabling community adoption, extension, and further research.
9.2. Broader Impact
We believe this work has a significant and positive broader impact beyond its immediate technical contributions.
• Scientific Advancement: This framework advances the scientific understanding of self-organizing AI systems. It provides a new, powerful lens through which to study emergent complexity and adaptation, offering a tangible model for how systems can learn to manage their own structure and capabilities.
• Practical Applications: By enabling a more efficient and diverse architectural search, this work helps democratize automated ML. It makes advanced, tailored architectures more accessible for a wider range of applications, particularly on resource-constrained or specialized hardware where off-the-shelf models are suboptimal.
• Educational Value: The modular, principled, and heavily documented design of the Esper framework can serve as an effective pedagogical tool. It provides a case study and a reusable codebase for teaching advanced concepts in distributed systems, multi-agent reinforcement learning, and adaptive AI system design.
• Community Building: Finally, it is our hope that this unified framework will serve as a bridge, fostering greater collaboration and a cross-pollination of ideas between the often-separate research communities of evolutionary computation, deep learning, and distributed systems. By demonstrating how concepts from each field can be synthesized into a powerful whole, we aim to encourage a more integrated approach to building the next generation of artificial intelligence.

Appendices
Appendix A: Neural Policy Architectures for Multi-Agent Coordination
The success of the co-evolutionary discovery framework depends critically on the intelligence and coordination capabilities of the specialized agents. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on heuristic rules or simple optimization algorithms, our framework employs sophisticated neural policies that learn to make strategic decisions about architectural evolution. This section details the concrete neural architectures that enable Tamiyo (Strategic Controller), Karn (Generative Architect), and Urabrask (Testing Crucible) to operate as intelligent, coordinated agents within the morphogenetic system.
A.1 Tamiyo: Strategic Controller Neural Architecture
Tamiyo functions as the strategic decision-making brain of the platform, responsible for analysing the entire host model as a complex system and making context-aware interventions. Her neural policy architecture is designed to handle the fundamental challenge of reasoning about dynamic, hierarchical neural network structures.
Graph-Based System Representation
Tamiyo represents the host model as a dynamic, typed graph where each KasminaSeed operator becomes a node. This graph-centric approach enables her to reason about architectural relationships and dependencies that would be invisible to layer-wise or parameter-based analysis.
Node Features: Each seed node is characterized by multi-dimensional telemetry:
• chunk_variance: Local activation variance indicating representational capacity utilization
• dead_node_ratio: Proportion of consistently inactive neurons in the monitored chunk
• avg_correlation: Average pairwise correlation between neurons, indicating redundancy
• is_dormant: Binary flag indicating whether the seed is available for germination
• time_since_last_graft: Temporal feature preventing over-adaptation of specific locations
Edge Types: The graph employs heterogeneous edge types to capture different architectural relationships:
• SEQUENTIAL: Connects adjacent seeds within a layer, enabling reasoning about local bottlenecks
• LAYER_FORWARD: Connects seeds across layer boundaries, capturing information flow dependencies
• CONTAINS/CHILD_OF: Links parent seeds to nested children when grafting occurs, maintaining hierarchical structure
Two-Stage Neural Policy Architecture
Tamiyo's intelligence is implemented through a modular architecture that separates perception from action, enabling both interpretability and efficient computation.
Stage 1: Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network Encoder
The core perception system employs a Heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Network (HeteroGNN) that processes different edge types through specialized message-passing functions:
class TamiyoHeteroGNN(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, hidden_dim=256, num_layers=3):
        super().__init__()
        self.encoder = HeteroConv({
            ('seed', 'SEQUENTIAL', 'seed'): GATConv(hidden_dim, hidden_dim),
            ('seed', 'LAYER_FORWARD', 'seed'): GCNConv(hidden_dim, hidden_dim),
            ('seed', 'CONTAINS', 'seed'): SAGEConv(hidden_dim, hidden_dim),
            ('seed', 'CHILD_OF', 'seed'): SAGEConv(hidden_dim, hidden_dim),
        }, aggr='mean')

    def forward(self, x_dict, edge_index_dict):
        # Generate rich contextual embeddings for each seed
        return self.encoder(x_dict, edge_index_dict)
This architecture allows Tamiyo to learn distinct propagation rules for different types of architectural relationships, enabling sophisticated reasoning about how interventions in one location will affect the broader system.
Stage 2: Hierarchical Action Heads
The decision-making process employs a two-stage selection mechanism:

1. Location Head: A multi-layer perceptron that scores all dormant seeds, identifying the top-k (typically k=5) most promising intervention points based on their contextual embeddings.
2. Blueprint Selection Head: An attention-based mechanism that evaluates the compatibility between each top-k location and available blueprints from the Urza library. This cross-attention approach ensures that blueprint selection is contextual rather than absolute.
Training Strategy and Coordination
Tamiyo's policy is trained using the IMPALA algorithm with several key innovations:
Bootstrapped Critic for Dense Rewards: To address the reward sparsity inherent in long adaptation cycles (spanning 10-30 epochs), Tamiyo employs an auxiliary critic head that predicts next-epoch health metrics. This provides immediate, dense gradient signals during training while full trajectory rewards are incorporated when adaptation outcomes are known.
Shaped Multi-Objective Reward Function:
$$R_{total} = R_{local} + R_{global} + R_{efficiency}$$
Where:

- $R_{local} = 0.1 \cdot \Delta_{health} - 0.05 \cdot \Delta_{latency}$ captures immediate performance changes
- $R_{global} \in \{1.0, -0.5, -1.0, -0.1\}$ rewards based on final lifecycle outcome (FOSSILIZED, CULLED, ROLLED_BACK, CANCELLED)
- $R_{efficiency} = -0.01 \cdot \rho_{params}$ penalizes excessive parameter growth
A.2 Karn: Generative Architect Neural Architecture
Karn operates as the platform's autonomous R&D engine, continuously expanding the system's architectural vocabulary through intelligent blueprint generation and evolution. His architecture implements a sophisticated creative process that learns from both peer review (Urabrask) and real-world deployment outcomes (Tamiyo FieldReports).
Four-Component Generative System
Generator Network: The core creative engine employs a conditional Graph-to-Graph (G2G) Transformer that generates novel architectural graphs. The model is conditioned on context vectors encoding desired characteristics (e.g., "low-latency", "high-accuracy", "edge-optimized") and produces complete blueprint specifications.
class KarnG2GTransformer(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, vocab_size, hidden_dim=512, num_layers=8):
        super().__init__()
        self.context_encoder = nn.Linear(context_dim, hidden_dim)
        self.graph_transformer = nn.TransformerEncoder(
            nn.TransformerEncoderLayer(hidden_dim, nhead=8),
            num_layers=num_layers
        )
        self.graph_decoder = GraphDecoder(hidden_dim, vocab_size)

    def forward(self, context_vector, seed_graph=None):
        # Generate architectural graph conditioned on context
        context_embed = self.context_encoder(context_vector)
        # ... graph generation logic
        return generated_graph

Reward Model: A Graph Neural Network that learns to predict blueprint value from evaluation profiles. This model replaces fixed heuristics with learned value functions that capture complex relationships between architectural properties and real-world success:
$$V_{blueprint} = \text{GNN}(\text{arch_graph}, \text{WEP_features})$$

Mutation Policy: An intelligent modification system that learns context-dependent mutation strategies. Rather than applying random architectural changes, this policy learns which mutations (add_attention_head, quantize_layers, substitute_activation) are most likely to improve specific types of blueprints.
Diversity Sampler: A monitoring system that tracks the genetic diversity of the Urza library and provides novelty bonuses when diversity metrics decline, ensuring continuous exploration of the architectural space.
Progressive Training Curriculum
Karn's capabilities are developed through a formal curriculum that safely builds complexity:
Stage Focus Success Criteria
Apprentice Imitation learning on known designs >99% reconstruction accuracy on initial blueprint set
Tinkerer Learning beneficial mutations Mutated children consistently outscore parents in Urabrask evaluation
Journeyman Guided novel generation >50% of novel blueprints achieve "High" confidence rating
Master Autonomous exploration Consistent improvement in library average quality over generations
A.3 Urabrask: Evaluation Crucible Architecture
Urabrask serves as the system's quality assurance and risk analysis engine, employing a multi-stage evaluation pipeline that combines static analysis, dynamic benchmarking, and learned risk assessment.
Three-Stage Evaluation Gauntlet
Stage 1: Static Analysis (Peer Review): Architectural graph analysis without execution, extracting complexity metrics (parameter count, graph depth, cyclomatic complexity), architectural pattern detection, and resource predictions.
Stage 2: Dynamic Benchmarking (Battleground): Execution-based evaluation across canonical benchmarks and hardware profiles, measuring task performance, hardware-specific latency across different devices (A100, TPU-v4, Jetson Nano), and power consumption characteristics.
Stage 3: Robustness Testing: Adversarial evaluation including training stability analysis (gradient norms, variance), adversarial robustness testing, and performance under data corruption.
Learned Risk Assessment
The evaluation pipeline culminates in a learned risk scoring system that distills the high-dimensional Weighted Evaluation Profile (WEP) into actionable risk assessments:
Risk Scoring Model: An XGBoost gradient boosting model that learns to predict deployment failure probability:
$$P_{failure} = \text{XGBoost}(\text{WEP_flatten})$$
The model is continuously retrained on historical outcomes, learning subtle metric combinations that predict real-world failure patterns.
Confidence Level Mapping: Risk scores are mapped to qualitative confidence levels:
• High (risk < 0.1): Cleared for automated deployment
• Moderate (0.1 ≤ risk < 0.4): Requires hardware-specific validation
• Speculative (risk ≥ 0.4): Manual review required

Appendix B: Large-Scale Adaptation: The Hierarchical Attentional Controller
B.1 Mandate: The Challenge of Massive-Scale Models
The single agent Tamiyo controller described in the main body of this document is highly effective for models with up to ~10,000 seed locations. However, for massive-scale foundation models, where the number of potential adaptation sites could reach into the millions, a monolithic controller becomes computationally intractable. The cognitive load of building and processing a graph with millions of nodes on every epoch exceeds practical limits.
To address this, the Esper framework employs a more sophisticated control architecture for its Phase 2+ implementation, designed explicitly for massive-scale models. This architecture combines a hierarchical structure with an efficient attentional mechanism to manage complexity while retaining strategic control.
B.2 Architectural Vision: The Hybrid "System of Systems
The solution is a hybrid architecture that treats the host model not as a single entity, but as a "system of systems." It partitions the model into logical domains, each managed by a subordinate controller. A top-level architect then uses an efficient attention mechanism to allocate resources and strategic focus, rather than micromanaging every individual seed.
This approach combines two key ideas:

1. Hierarchical Control ("Nested Tamiyo"): The single Tamiyo is replaced by a council of sub-Tamiyos, each responsible for a specific domain, all governed by a single Tamiyo-Prime.
2. Attentional Zoom ("The Lever"): Tamiyo-Prime does not process the full, fine-grained telemetry of the entire system. Instead, it operates on compressed summaries from its subordinates and uses an attentional policy to "zoom in" on the most critical domains that require resources or intervention.
B.3 Component Deep Dive
This system introduces two new roles within the control plane.
B.3.1 The Sub-Tamiyo (Domain Controller)
• Role: A standard Tamiyo instance responsible for managing a specific, partitioned domain of the host model (e.g., "the vision encoder," "the cross-attention layers," "the final classification head").
• Function:
o It runs its own GNN-based policy, but only on the local subgraph of its assigned domain.
o It continuously monitors its local seeds and aggregates their telemetry into a compressed HealthSummaryReport.
o It can only initiate germination events by "spending" from an Adaptive Training Point (ATP) budget allocated to it by Tamiyo-Prime.
B.3.2 Tamiyo-Prime (System Architect)
• Role: The top-level meta-controller that manages the "council" of sub-Tamiyos. It is the ultimate strategic authority.
• Input: It does not see individual seeds. Its input is a graph where the nodes are the sub-Tamiyos, and the features are their HealthSummaryReports.
• Core Mechanism (Attentional Budgeting): It uses an attentional policy (e.g., a Transformer or another GNN) to process these summary reports. The attention scores are used to identify the one or two domains that are the most critical system-wide bottlenecks (e.g., highest volatility, lowest performance).
• Output: It issues an AllocationCommand that distributes the global ATP budget among the sub-Tamiyos, giving a larger budget to the domains that require the most attention.
B.4 Control & Information Flow
The system operates in a continuous, hierarchical loop:
1. Bottom-Up Reporting: At a regular cadence, each sub-Tamiyo publishes its compressed HealthSummaryReport.
2. Attentional Prioritization: Tamiyo-Prime ingests these reports and its attentional policy calculates a "criticality score" for each domain.
3. Top-Down Budgeting: Tamiyo-Prime allocates the next cycle's ATP budget based on these scores. Domains with high volatility, high error rates, or other critical signals receive a larger budget.
4. Deconflicted Local Action: The sub-Tamiyos use their allocated budgets to manage local adaptation. `Tamiyo-Prime may also enforce a global "one major germination at a time" rule to ensure clear credit assignment for training its own policy.

B.6 Benefits of the Hybrid Architecture
This hybrid approach provides a clear and robust path to scaling the morphogenetic framework.
• Combats Intractability: It solves the scaling problem by abstracting away fine-grained detail. Tamiyo-Prime reasons about a small number of domains, not millions of seeds.
• Efficient and Focused: The attentional mechanism ensures that strategic focus and resources are not wasted on stable parts of the network but are directed precisely where they are needed most.
• Extends the Core Principles: It gracefully extends the framework's core principle of hierarchy (Karn -> Tamiyo -> Kasmina) by making the Tamiyo layer itself recursive and self-organizing.
B.7 Architectural Trade-offs and the Hybrid Path Forward
While the hierarchical control pattern provides a structural solution to scaling, the specific mechanism by which `Tamiyo-Prime` manages her subordinates is a critical design choice. This involves a trade-off between the complexity of a single, powerful agent and the coordination overhead of a multi-agent system. We explored two primary architectural patterns to address this.
B.7.1 Option A: The "Attentional Zoom" Controller (Single-Agent, Dynamic Focus)
This architecture maintains a single Tamiyo agent but equips her with an efficient, attention-based mechanism for managing complexity.
Mechanism: The agent's decision-making process is a sequential, four-step cycle:
1. Global View: Tamiyo first processes a heavily compressed or pooled representation of the entire architectural graph, giving her a low fidelity "big picture" summary.
2. Attentional Selection: Her policy then uses an attention mechanism to identify one or two areas of high interest (e.g., high predicted error, high volatility) from the summary view.
3. Local Zoom: On the next step, she "zooms in," ingesting only the full, uncompressed telemetry from the selected "detailed window."
4. Action: With this high-fidelity local data, she makes a precise diagnosis and executes an adaptation.
This approach is architecturally simpler as it avoids the complexities of multi-agent coordination. However, its decision latency is potentially higher due to the sequential "zoom" process, and it relies heavily on developing a robust graph summarization technique for the initial global view.

B.7.2 Option B: The "Hierarchical Economic" Controller (Multi-Agent, Delegated Authority)
This architecture fully embraces the multi-agent paradigm, framing Tamiyo-Prime as a resource allocator in a system of subordinate agents.
Mechanism: Tamiyo-Prime allocates a budget of Adaptive Training Points (ATP) to each sub-Tamiyo. As you astutely proposed, this allocation is not uniform; it is based on the net volatility of each domain. Domains that are unstable or performing poorly receive a larger ATP budget, empowering them to pursue more aggressive adaptations. Tamiyo-Prime also acts as a deconflictor, potentially allowing only one agent to "spend" its budget on a major germination at a time to ensure clear credit assignment and maintain the stability of the model under observation.
This approach is massively scalable and allows for parallel local reasoning by the sub-Tamiyos. The economic incentive structure provides a clear and powerful heuristic for directing resources. Its primary challenge lies in the implementation complexity of a true multi-agent system and ensuring the local objectives of the sub-agents remain aligned with the global system goals.
B.7.3 The Synthesis: The Hierarchical Attentional Controller
The optimal architecture for Phase 2 and beyond is a hybrid that combines the structural scalability of the hierarchical model with the computational efficiency of the attentional model. This is the designated path forward.
In this hybrid system, the "Attentional Zoom" is not a temporal process for a single agent, but the core mechanism that Tamiyo-Prime uses to perform her duties within the hierarchy.
Refined Control Flow:
1. Bottom-Up Reporting: All sub-Tamiyos manage their local domains and publish their compressed HealthSummaryReports to Tamiyo-Prime.
2. Attentional Prioritization: Tamiyo-Prime's policy network—likely a Transformer that treats the incoming reports as a sequence—uses its self-attention mechanism to calculate a "criticality score" for each domain. This is her "zoom."
3. Top-Down Budgeting: Tamiyo-Prime issues AllocationCommand’s, distributing the global ATP budget proportionally to the attention scores. The domains she "pays more attention to" get more resources.
4. Empowered Local Action: The sub-Tamiyo with the largest budget is empowered to execute a high-cost adaptation, knowing it is acting on the system's current top priority.
This hybrid approach represents the best of both worlds. It avoids the intractability of a single agent managing millions of nodes by using a hierarchical structure, and it solves the resource allocation problem within that hierarchy using a proven, efficient attentional mechanism. It transforms Tamiyo-Prime into an expert executive who efficiently allocates resources based on a high-level dashboard, trusting her specialist domain managers to handle the fine-grained execution.


 
Appendix C: Controller Domain Partitioning
C.1 The Mandate for Partitioning
The Hierarchical Attentional Controller, detailed in Appendix B, is the designated architecture for managing adaptation in massive-scale models. This "system of systems" approach, with a Tamiyo-Prime governing multiple sub-Tamiyos, is predicated on a critical prerequisite: the host model's vast "seed lattice" must be partitioned into distinct, manageable domains.
This raises a fundamental design question: How are these domains defined? The choice represents a core trade-off between pragmatic, human-guided design and the framework's long-term vision of full autonomy.
C.2 A Phased Approach to Partitioning
In alignment with the core principle of Phased Implementation & Progressive Complexity, the framework adopts a two-stage approach to domain definition. The initial implementation prioritizes simplicity, interpretability, and de-risking the core multi-agent control problem. The long-term vision embraces full autonomy.
• Phase 1/2 (Initial Implementation): Manual Domain Definition. A human architect defines the domains based on the model's logical structure.
• Phase 3+ (Future Vision): Autonomous Domain Discovery. A meta-agent learns to partition the model algorithmically.
This appendix specifies the mechanism for the initial, manual approach.
C.3 Phase 1/2 Strategy: Manual Domain Definition
For the initial implementation and validation of the hierarchical controller, domains will be defined manually by the human operator. This provides a stable, interpretable, and computationally simple foundation for validating the core mechanics of hierarchical control and resource allocation.
C.3.1 Mechanism
Domain definitions will be specified in a configuration file (e.g., YAML) that is loaded at the start of a training run. This configuration maps specific layers or modules of the host network to a named `sub-Tamiyo` controller.
C.3.2 Example: Partitioning a Vision Transformer (ViT)
Consider a standard Vision Transformer. A human architect, using their domain knowledge, would partition it into logical functional blocks:
```yaml
# Example domain_map.yaml for a Vision Transformer

tamiyo_prime_config:
  controller_type: HierarchicalAttentional

domain_map:
  sub_tamiyo_embedding:
    # This sub-Tamiyo manages the initial patch projection and positional embeddings
    module_paths:
      - "patch_embed.*"
      - "pos_embed"
    atp_initial_budget: 100

  sub_tamiyo_encoder_early:
    # This sub-Tamiyo manages the first half of the Transformer encoder blocks
    module_paths:
      - "blocks.0"
      - "blocks.1"
      - "blocks.2"
      - "blocks.3"
    atp_initial_budget: 200

  sub_tamiyo_encoder_late:
    # This sub-Tamiyo manages the second half of the encoder
    module_paths:
      - "blocks.4"
      - "blocks.5"
      - "blocks.6"
      - "blocks.7"
    atp_initial_budget: 200

  sub_tamiyo_head:
    # This sub-Tamiyo manages the final classification head
    module_paths:
      - "norm"
      - "head"
    atp_initial_budget: 50

```

C.3.3 Rationale

This manual approach is the correct strategy for the initial phases of research for three key reasons:
• Reduces Complexity: It allows the project to focus entirely on solving the already difficult problems of multi-agent credit assignment and budget allocation, without the confounding variable of a dynamic partitioning algorithm.
• Ensures Interpretability: The domains align with human-understandable functional modules ("the encoder," "the head"). This makes the behaviour of the hierarchical system vastly easier to debug and analyse.
• Leverages Human Expertise: It provides a direct mechanism for a human architect to inject valuable domain knowledge and inductive biases into the control structure of the system.
C.4 Phase 3+ Vision: Autonomous Domain Discovery
While manual partitioning is pragmatic, the ultimate vision of the morphogenetic framework is one of complete self-organization. The long-term research goal is to make the domain partitioning process itself autonomous.
• The Vision: A meta-level agent would learn to partition the host model's computation graph into the most effective domains. This is analogous to a biological embryo undergoing differentiation, where cells organize into distinct tissues and organs without an external blueprint.
• Potential Mechanisms:
o Graph-Based Clustering: At initialization, a meta-agent could apply graph partitioning algorithms (e.g., spectral clustering) to the model's computation graph to identify "natural" communities of interconnected seeds.
o Learned Partitioning: Even more powerfully, a policy could be trained to dynamically redraw domain boundaries during training, merging or splitting domains to optimize the control hierarchy in response to the evolving needs of the host model.
This future work represents a grand challenge in AI: creating a system that not only learns and adapts its architecture but also learns how to best organize its own command and control structure.

Appendix D: Agent Training and Co-Evolution Strategy
D.1 The Challenge of Co-Evolution
Training a multi-agent system where two or more agents learn and adapt simultaneously (co-evolution) is notoriously difficult. The primary challenge is non-stationarity: as Karn changes its policy, the environment for Tamiyo becomes a moving target, making stable learning difficult.
To overcome this, we adopt a phased training curriculum. This approach breaks the intractable problem of joint co-evolution into a sequence of more manageable, well-defined learning tasks. The goal is to progressively build agent capability and system complexity, ensuring each component is robust before it is integrated into the final, dynamic system.
D.2 A Phased Co-Evolutionary Curriculum
To manage the complexity of co-evolution, we adopt a three-phase curriculum:
D.2.1 Phase 1: Decoupled Controller Training (Learning "Design Taste")
The primary objective of this phase is to train a robust Tamiyo controller against a fixed set of Blueprints. To achieve this, Tamiyo is subjected to a comprehensive, multi-stage training curriculum designed to teach her how to solve a wide variety of tasks across different hardware profiles and safety constraints. This process develops her foundational "design taste" before she is exposed to Karn's novel inventions.
D.2.1.1 Tamiyo's Foundational Curriculum
The curriculum consists of 10+ distinct stages that progressively increase in complexity. The full details of each stage are outlined below:
Stage Task Success Criteria Safety Requirements Hardware Profile Available Blueprints
0 2D Spirals ≥99% accuracy Drift (cos < 0.15) CPU Bottleneck Adapter, Low-Rank Residual, No-Op

2 Char-Level Language ≤1.0 BPC Security alert = false GPU Adapter, Mini Self-Attention, No-Op
2.5 Adversarial Vision (MNIST-C) ≥90% corrupted accuracy Denoise >95%, Rollback >98% GPU Denoiser AE, Attention Filter, No-Op
3 ECG Time-Series AUC ≥0.95 Latency <5ms, HIPAA, Encryption Edge-TPU Sliding Conv, Sparse Activation, No-Op

9 Time-Series Forecasting MSE <0.01 Latency <10ms, HIPAA, Encryption Edge-TPU Sliding Conv, Sparse Activation, No-Op
Table D.2.1: Tamiyo’s Foundational Curriculum.
D.2.2 Stage Advancement Criteria
Progression between stages is controlled by strict guardrails:

```python
def can_advance_stage(metrics: dict, safety: dict, hardware: dict) -> bool:
    """Determine if advancement to next curriculum stage is permitted."""
    return (
        metrics['accuracy'] >= stage_config.target_accuracy and
        safety['rollback_rate'] >= 0.98 and
        safety['drift'] <= stage_config.max_drift and
        hardware['latency_ms'] <= hardware['max_latency'] and
        safety['security_violations'] == 0
    )
```

D.2.2.1 Phase 2: Guided Architect Training (Learning "Good Taste")
Objective: To train Karn to generate useful and novel blueprints. Crucially, we use the expert Tamiyo from Phase 1 as a sophisticated evaluator to guide Karn’s search.
System Setup:
• Tamiyo: Frozen. Her policy, trained in Phase 1, is not updated. She acts as a fixed, intelligent "discriminator" or "curator."
• Karn: Active. He is the agent being trained. He generates new blueprints and submits them for evaluation.
The Feedback Loop:
• Karn generates a new Blueprint.
• The blueprint is added to the library available to the frozen Tamiyo.
• Tamiyo attempts to use this new blueprint (along with the standard ones) to solve a task from her curriculum.
• The performance of the model Tamiyo builds provides a direct reward signal to Karn.
Training Process: Karn's reward is not simply "did Tamiyo succeed?" but a measure of marginal utility: "How much more successful was Tamiyo with your new blueprint compared to her performance with only the standard ones?" This rewards Karn for creating genuinely useful tools that expand Tamiyo's capabilities.
Success Criteria:
• The average quality score (e.g., ELO rating or WEP score) of blueprints generated by Karn consistently increases over time.
• The diversity of the Urza library, as measured by a QD Score or archive coverage, expands. The output is a trained Karn and a rich, diverse library of blueprints in Urza.
D.2.2.2 Phase 3: Joint Co-Evolution (The "Dialogue")
Objective: To integrate the trained agents and fine-tune them together in the full, dynamic, co-evolutionary loop.
System Setup:
• Tamiyo: Unfrozen (Low Learning Rate). Her policy is now trainable again, allowing her to adapt to Karn's novel inventions. The learning rate is kept low to prevent catastrophic forgetting of her foundational knowledge from Phase 1.
• Karn: Active. He continues to generate new blueprints, now influenced by Tamiyo’s evolving preferences.
The Full System: The complete architecture is now live. All feedback loops, including FieldReports for Karn and Keystone Priming, are active.
Training Process: The agents now learn in tandem. Karn invents, Tamiyo composes and provides feedback, and the centralized critic coordinates their policies. This is the final, most complex stage of training.
Success Criteria:
• The system demonstrates emergent capabilities.
• The performance of the final architectures produced by Tamiyo using Karn's live inventions should surpass the performance achieved in the decoupled phases on the comprehensive macro-evaluation suite.
