# Conceptual Foundations

## 2.1 Morphogenetic Architecture
The term morphogenetic architecture refers to a neural network design paradigm in which a static, frozen model is permitted to undergo controlled, localised structural evolution through the activation and training of embedded seed modules. These seeds act as encapsulated loci of potential development—capable of instantiating new parameters or substructures that expand or enhance the host model’s functionality, without modifying its pre-existing weights or topology.
This architectural strategy draws loose inspiration from biological morphogenesis, where structures develop from localised triggers and encoded developmental rules rather than global template changes. However, the intent here is strictly functional: enabling targeted increases in representational or behavioural capacity under strict global constraints (cf. Parisi et al., 2019).
Key features of a morphogenetic architecture:

| Feature             | Description                                                                                                           |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Frozen base         | Pre‑trained, static model; most parameters and structures are immutable post‑deployment                               |
| Embedded seeds      | One or more seed modules at specific sites (e.g., bottlenecks or performance‑critical pathways)                       |
| Germination policy  | Rules defining when and how a seed may activate and instantiate additional structure                                   |
| Local training only | Optimisation constrained to the seed’s scope; newly germinated parameters may be trained; base weights remain frozen   |
This design is intended to preserve operational consistency, reproducibility, and safety guarantees while still allowing for adaptive behaviour and capacity extension when required.
## 2.2 The Role of the Seed
A seed is the atomic unit of morphogenetic change. It is a tensor or module—initialised but untrained—embedded within a frozen host network and designed to remain inert unless explicitly triggered by the surrounding context. Seeds instantiate additional structure (e.g., sub‑layer, micro‑network, branching path) in response to local signals:

| Trigger Signal                | Example                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| High task loss/plateau        | Persistent prediction error                                             |
| Activation bottleneck         | Low variance, vanishing signal                                          |
| Minimal representational fail | Features fail basic separability thresholds                             |
Once triggered, a seed germinates, instantiating its internal structure and enabling gradient flow within its local scope. In most designs, the seed’s internal structure begins near-identity (e.g., skip connections or reparameterised no-ops) to minimise disruption, and gradually evolves towards a meaningful learned transformation.
A seed may encode:

| Element                    | Description                                                                                          |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Structural blueprint      | Topology and layer types of the module to be instantiated                                            |
| Parameter initialisation  | Specific weight values or parameter distributions                                                    |
| Control policy            | Rules for when and how germination occurs                                                            |
| Loss contract             | Local optimisation targets that define success (e.g., reduce residual error, increase separability)  |
In practice, the seed interface must be carefully constructed to ensure compatibility with upstream and downstream signals, preserve input-output dimensionality, and avoid gradient leakage or interference across model boundaries.
## 2.3 Core Constraints and System Tensions
The seed-based approach introduces a set of intentional constraints and unresolved tensions that shape its design space:
Constraint Description
Frozen base The host model is not updated or retrained. Only seed modules may be modified.
Local learning Optimisation is confined to the seed and its internal parameters. No external gradient propagation is permitted.
Structural isolation Seeds must not introduce side effects, change tensor shapes, or compromise compatibility of the model pipeline.
Trigger discipline Germination must occur only under defined and justified conditions to avoid uncontrolled capacity growth.
These constraints reflect the deployment realities that motivate this design: systems that must remain functionally stable over long periods, support internal augmentation without global revalidation, and isolate new behaviour for auditability and safety review (Sun et al., 2024).
However, these same constraints introduce system tensions, including:
• Limited feedback: the seed may not receive sufficient gradient signal or task information to optimise effectively.
• Structural rigidity: the inability to rewire or adapt upstream components may limit the expressivity of any local adaptation.
• Interference risk: while the base model is frozen, its outputs can still be indirectly influenced by newly inserted seed modules. Care must be taken to avoid functional drift.
These tensions do not undermine the approach but define the boundaries within which it must operate. Subsequent sections address how structural design, interface specification, and careful optimisation can resolve or mitigate these limitations.
