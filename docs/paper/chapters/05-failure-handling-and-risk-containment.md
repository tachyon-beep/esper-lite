# Failure Handling and Risk Containment
Morphogenetic systems, by design, explore the edges of known behaviour. While powerful, seed germination introduces significant failure potential. This framework approaches risk containment with a layered defensive model built directly into the seed lifecycle: detect failure within a specific phase, terminate the failed growth cleanly via culling, and log the event precisely for future learning.
## 5.1 Germination Failure Modes and Lifecycle Validation
Common failure modes and their descriptions:

| Failure Mode           | Description                                                                                  |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Structural Misfit      | Graft-incompatible shape or mismatched dimensions at the interface site.                     |
| Functional Nullity     | Child network integrates but provides no measurable utility (e.g., flat activations).        |
| Training Collapse      | Local optimiser fails to converge; exploding gradients or NaN during the TRAINING phase.     |
| Destabilising Emergence| New module degrades pre-existing competencies; detected in the PROBATIONARY phase.           |

Validation checks mapped to lifecycle states:

| Phase  | Lifecycle State | Primary Checks                                                                                           | Outcome on Failure |
|--------|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| 1      | TRAINING         | Non-zero gradient norms; bounded weight changes; local loss improvement after N steps                   | CULLED             |
| 2      | SHADOWING        | Internal stability with inert forward; probe with live data; reject chaotic/unbounded outputs           | CULLED             |
| 3      | PROBATIONARY     | Systemic impact: monitor global metrics (val_loss, val_acc) within tolerance                           | CULLED             |
## 5.2 The Culling and Embargo Protocol
This framework replaces ambiguous “rollback” procedures with a formal, state-driven Culling and Embargo protocol managed by the SeedManager.

| Aspect                    | Description                                                                                                                       |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Transition to CULLED      | On validation failure, the seed enters the terminal CULLED state; parameters are frozen and marked inactive (non-destructive).     |
| Architectural Embargo     | Records the failure and places the slot under a timed embargo to prevent thrashing via immediate re-germination.                   |
| Re-entry to DORMANT       | After embargo, the module is reset to DORMANT and becomes eligible for a new attempt, often with a different blueprint from Karn.  |
Each culling event is recorded in a SeedManager log, including failure type, the lifecycle stage at which it failed, and the blueprint used. This enables later audit, forensics, and pattern mining of recurrent faults.
## 5.3 Interface Drift Detection
Frozen-base systems can still experience interface drift when a graft modifies the statistical distribution of features passed downstream. This is a primary failure condition checked during the PROBATIONARY stage, and relates to representational stability concerns studied in alignment work (e.g., Wortsman et al., 2024).

| Detection Method              | Description                                                                                 |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Activation Trace Monitoring  | Compare layer-wise activation distributions (mean, variance) with a pre-germination baseline |
| Cosine Shift Metrics         | Track cosine similarity at key junctions to measure representational shift                  |
Drift exceeding task-specific tolerances during the PROBATIONARY phase is considered a failure and triggers a transition to the CULLED state.
## 5.4 Failure Analysis and System Safeguards
When a seed fails repeatedly, the system uses logged data to learn and adapt.

| Safeguard               | Description                                                                                                                   |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Failure Pattern Mining  | Mine the culling log for recurrent patterns (e.g., failing blueprints, toxic initialisations) to inform Karn/Tamiyo policies. |
| Emergency Kill Switch   | Abort on systemic instability; force CULLED and revert to last known-good network state.                                      |
## 5.5 Summary
Failure handling in this framework is not reactive—it is an integrated and anticipatory part of the seed lifecycle. Every seed is treated as a hypothesis to be rigorously tested. Failures are handled cleanly through the Culling and Embargo protocol, ensuring system stability. The detailed logging of these events provides a rich dataset for improving the governing policies of Karn and Tamiyo, making the entire system safer and more intelligent over time. Each failure teaches the system what not to become.

## 5.6 Safety Stack (Prototype)
The prototype implements the production safety controls. The following mechanisms are active during all experiments:

| Mechanism                       | Description                                                                                   | Outcome / Action                         |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Gradient isolation              | Backward hooks enforce strict separation of host and seed gradients; safe blending            | Violations increment breaker; quarantine |
| Circuit breakers                | Thresholded counters across health, gradients, stability, latency                            | Downgrade to conservative mode; alerts   |
| Lifecycle validation gates      | Checks at key stages (germination, training, blending, shadowing, probationary, resetting)   | Transition to CULLED on failure          |
| Quarantine & embargo            | Seeds moved to CULLED; slot embargoed; reset after embargo window                            | Prevents thrashing at failure sites      |
| Checkpoint & rollback           | Checkpoints emitted; quick rollback available on critical anomalies                           | Rapid recovery to last known‑good state  |
| Authenticated control messages  | Control messages are authenticated and subject to freshness windows                           | Replays rejected; conservative mode      |
| Telemetry backpressure          | Emergency signals bypass; non‑critical streams drop on saturation                             | Stability under overload                 |
