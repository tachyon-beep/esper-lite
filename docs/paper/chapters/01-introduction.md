# Introduction

## Overview: A New Approach for Adaptive Systems
While techniques for modular and parameter‑efficient adaptation, such as adapters and network surgery, have shown promise, they often lack a cohesive, system‑level framework for ensuring safety, auditability, and autonomous control. This paper seeks to bridge that gap by establishing the formal groundwork for morphogenetic computing: a discipline where neural networks are treated not as static artefacts, but as dynamic systems capable of controlled, localised, and auditable structural evolution.
Rather than proposing an entirely new low-level mechanism, this work introduces a unifying framework orchestrated by a co-evolutionary system of intelligent agents. This system features:
An external 'inventor' agent, Karn, which discovers and validates a diverse library of architectural blueprints in a competitive environment.
An internal 'policy controller' agent, Tamiyo, which monitors the host network's real-time performance and telemetry to strategically select and deploy Karn's blueprints, triggering growth precisely where it is needed. This agent-driven approach transforms the abstract idea of a 'policy-governed lifecycle' into a concrete, trainable, and auditable engineering reality.
The core contribution is a holistic system built upon a foundation of several key strengths:
Conceptual Rigor: The system is defined by a precise vocabulary—distinguishing between a Seed, the act of Germination, and the constraints of an Interface Contract. This creates an unambiguous language for designing, building, and debating these complex adaptive systems.
Meaningful Biological Fidelity: The core metaphors map directly to established biological processes. Karn's discovery process acts like a genetic engine, generating a diverse 'gene pool' of potential traits (the blueprints). Tamiyo serves as the developmental programme, selecting which genes to express in response to environmental pressures. Sentinel Seeds function as latent, multipotent stem cells, and the injection of a blueprint triggers a highly‑structured cellular differentiation process—from training and gradual blending to systemic validation and, ultimately, permanent fossilisation into the host's 'tissue'. Safety protocols that cull failed grafts mirror apoptosis, removing non‑viable mutations.
Holistic Systems Thinking: The architecture addresses the full system lifecycle: from development (germination policies) and deployment (interface contracts) to senescence (quarantine buffers and controlled freezing). This end-to-end perspective is critical for real-world application.
Safety by Design: Growth is not permitted to be chaotic. The entire framework is built around auditable safety, incorporating three-phase germination validation, cryptographic lineage tracking for every change, and robust drift detection to ensure that adaptation remains controlled and predictable.
Within this framework, this document introduces several critical innovations that represent a significant departure from traditional methods:
First is the evolution of the Seed from a passive placeholder into an active sensor and programmable gateway. By constantly streaming telemetry (like activation variance and local error) to the Tamiyo controller, each seed provides the critical, real-time data necessary for intelligent, system-wide decision-making. When commanded by Tamiyo, the seed then acts as the execution site, ensuring the injection of a new blueprint adheres to the local architectural contract.
Building on this, the Tamiyo policy controller learns to manage the entire network's evolution. By analysing telemetry from all seed sites simultaneously, it moves beyond simple protocols to perform intelligent, multi-seed arbitration, prioritising resources and preventing conflicts to enable emergent structural cooperation. This foreshadows the formation of complex neural "tissues" and moves beyond simple, isolated changes.
Crucially, this process is interpretable. The resulting germination logs create biographical architectures, where a model's final topology is a readable, causal record of its developmental history. For the first time, we can ask not only what a model is, but how it came to be.
Finally, the framework re-contextualizes failure. The quarantine buffer system treats failed germination events not as errors to be discarded, but as negative knowledge to be logged and learned from. This creates a system that intelligently and safely prunes its own evolutionary search space.
In synthesis, these principles formalize neural ontogeny—the study of an organism's development—as a discrete engineering discipline. By solving the plasticity-stability dilemma through enforced contracts and making growth auditable, this work lays the groundwork for a new generation of truly adaptive systems.

## 1.1 Motivation
This document defines a foundational mechanism for enabling localised structural adaptation within otherwise static neural architectures. The motivation is to allow systems to increase task-specific or representational capacity without retraining or reinitialising the global model. This is achieved through a biologically inspired construct referred to as a seed: a latent trainable element embedded within the host network, capable of germinating additional modules. In this framework, germination is not random; it is a controlled event, triggered by a dedicated policy controller in response to observed performance plateaus, and the germinated modules themselves are drawn from a library of validated architectural blueprints.
The primary application space for this technique includes:

| Context                               | Description                                                                                                 |
|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Low‑parameter models                  | <10M parameters; pre‑training budgets are fixed or prohibitive                                              |
| Edge hardware                         | Compute and memory tightly constrained; full retraining infeasible                                          |
| TinyML / Extreme edge                 | On‑device capacity is microscopic; adaptive growth is the only viable path                                  |
| Safety‑critical / long‑lived systems  | Retraining risks functional degradation or loss of certification                                            |
| Modular AI systems                    | Targeted capacity expansion or behavioural modification without global model churn                           |
Unlike traditional methods of continual learning, domain adaptation, or neural architecture search, the proposed seed mechanism operates entirely within a frozen base model, with no structural change to the host unless and until germination is triggered. This approach is specifically designed to preserve backwards compatibility, deterministic behaviour, and localised safety guarantees, while still allowing for new capabilities to emerge.
## 1.2 Objectives
The objectives of this document are:
• To define the operational concept of seed-bursting and its implementation in a modular neural network.
• To articulate the architectural constraints and interface contracts required to support localised structural evolution.
• To formalise a multi‑stage seed lifecycle that governs the evolution of a new module—from initial germination, through isolated training and gradual blending, to final validation and either permanent fossilisation or managed culling.
• To introduce a co-evolutionary, agent-based control system, comprising:
o An external 'inventor' agent (Karn) that discovers and validates a library of reusable, compressed Germinal Module (GM)s.
o An internal policy controller agent (Tamiyo) that learns to trigger germination by selecting the optimal seed site and GM blueprint in response to real-time network telemetry.
• To provide a minimal prototype and supporting micro-demonstration that confirms the viability of this agent-driven approach in practice.
These objectives are framed within a system context where strict modular boundaries, interface contracts, and controlled local learning are necessary to maintain overall system integrity.
## 1.3 Background and Context
This work evolves the concept of a morphogenetic seed from a standalone unit into a component of a larger, intelligent system. Where a seed was previously a self-contained representation of a potential capability, it now functions as an active sensor and execution site within a hierarchical control framework. The intelligence that governs growth is externalised into two specialised agents: Karn and Tamiyo.
This agent-based paradigm is inspired by prior work in multi-agent and reinforcement learning and shifts the focus from simple, hardcoded triggers to learned, emergent policies. Where the surrounding architecture remains frozen—either for safety, certification, reproducibility, or latency reasons—the seed provides a pathway to plasticity that is now governed by an explicit, auditable control agent rather than implicit heuristics.
The concept of injecting pre-trained modules is conceptually related to recent work in knowledge grafting and model stitching. However, the morphogenetic framework differs by focusing on autonomous, policy-driven germination within a single host. This process is governed by the Tamiyo agent, which dynamically selects from a library of Germinal Modules previously discovered and validated by the Karn agent. This creates a closed-loop system of discovery and deployment, distinguishing it from offline model fusion techniques.
## 1.4 Limitations
This document focuses exclusively on the mechanisms required for localised structural evolution within a neural model. It does not address:
• General continual learning or lifelong learning frameworks.
• Non-structural methods of modularity (e.g., sparse activation, gating).
• Global model optimisation, distillation, or fine-tuning.
While it intersects with some methods used in dynamic neural networks, it assumes that the frozen base model is not structurally altered or re-optimised, except through the addition of germinated modules via defined seed pathways. While the Tamiyo policy controller may be trained using reinforcement learning techniques, the framework's goal is not general, continuous adaptation but controlled, episodic structural enhancement. Mechanisms such as gradient flow constraints, interface contract enforcement, and safety isolation are assumed to be in place, but are not elaborated beyond the MVP implementation.
