# Simic2 Phases

This folder is the phase-by-phase execution workspace for the Simic2 refactor.

- Phase rationale lives in `docs/plans/planning/simic2/simic_vectorized_refactor_roadmap.md`.
- Each phase folder decomposes the roadmap into **dev-sized checklists**.
- When a phase is ready to implement, promote it to a single plan under `docs/plans/ready/`.
