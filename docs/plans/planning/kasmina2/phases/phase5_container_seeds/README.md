# Phase 5: Container Seeds (End-State Microstructure Planes)

This folder is a working plan surface. The phase details live in:

- `docs/plans/planning/kasmina2/kasmina_tamiyo_submodule_intervention_roadmap.md` (Phase 5 section)

## Objective

Move from “single seed per slot” to “container seeds” that can host multiple internal planes:

- a slot owns a container seed
- internal microstructure provides multiple levers/subtargets without proliferating slots
- fossilization semantics can include “merge into host” policies once stable

Phase 5 is the convergence point of Tracks A and C.

## Docs to write before coding Phase 5

- `container_contract.md` (what a container seed is; invariants; DDP symmetry constraints)
- `rent_and_churn.md` (parameter accounting for internal planes; shock costs)
- `telemetry.md` (inventory + health + attribution sensors)
- `experiments_and_gates.md` (ROI under scaling; stability; governance)
