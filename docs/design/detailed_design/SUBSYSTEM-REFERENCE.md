## PLANE INTERACTIONS

### Runtime Operations (Synchronous)
The Execution Plane (Tolaria, Kasmina) works with Control Plane (Tamiyo, Emrakul, Elesh) for live training:
- Tolaria provides temporal framework
- Kasmina executes kernels and modifications
- Tamiyo makes strategic decisions
- Emrakul+Elesh handle architectural changes

### Async Training Operations
Policy Training Plane (Simic, Jace) operates asynchronously:
- Simic trains Tamiyo's policies offline using experience replay
- Jace coordinates curriculum between Tamiyo and Simic
- Similar to Innovation Plane - not part of runtime control loop

### Innovation Pipeline (Async)
The Innovation Plane creates new blueprints asynchronously:
- Karn generates new blueprints (will train Karn's generative AI in future)
- Tezzeret compiles them to kernels
- Urabrask validates safety and performance
- Urza stores validated assets

**Critical**: Tamiyo can only select from blueprints already in Urza's library - cannot request new ones on demand.

### Training Pipelines (Both Async)
- **Policy Training**: Simic trains Tamiyo's policies asynchronously
- **Blueprint Innovation**: Future Karn will use generative AI (also async)
- Both operate outside the runtime control loop

### Infrastructure Support
- Oona enables all inter-subsystem communication
- Nissa provides observability for all operations
- Leyline defines all shared contracts

---

## KEY ARCHITECTURAL PRINCIPLES

1. **Plane Separation**: Innovation Plane is completely async from Execution
2. **Zero Disruption**: Training never stops for morphogenetic operations
3. **Package Deals**: Emrakul+Elesh work as coordinated pair
4. **Blueprint Library**: Only pre-validated blueprints can be used
5. **Checkpoint-Based**: Major modifications happen at checkpoint boundaries
6. **Safety First**: Multiple validation layers before any change
