## 1. Executive Summary

Tamiyo serves as the strategic decision-making brain of the Esper morphogenetic platform, orchestrating intelligent adaptation through enhanced policy intelligence while maintaining the zero-disruption morphogenetic training guarantee. This v4.1 design integrates comprehensive C-016 external review fixes to prevent production failures while providing strategic control through sophisticated neural architecture, comprehensive safety protocols, and production-ready learning algorithms.

### Core Innovation with C-016 Enhancements

- **Complete 4-Layer HeteroGNN**: Heterogeneous graph neural network for topology-aware strategic decisions
- **Enhanced UnifiedLRController Integration**: Exclusive learning rate mutation with circuit breaker protection
- **Production-Grade Pause Security**: Server-side quota enforcement with authorization framework
- **Memory Leak Prevention**: Enhanced garbage collection and bounded data structures
- **Async Decision Reliability**: Configurable deadlines with idempotency and fault tolerance
- **Zero Training Disruption**: All decisions remain non-blocking with enhanced error handling

### Leyline (Shared Contracts) Integration

All message contracts now use Leyline for consistency and performance:

```python
# Leyline contract imports (Option B - Performance-First)
from esper.leyline.contracts import (
    SystemStatePacket,     # Single uint32 version, native map<string, float> metrics
    AdaptationCommand,     # Unified command with LR policy integration
    EventEnvelope,         # Message bus envelope
    TelemetryPacket,       # Observability data
    HealthStatus,          # Circuit breaker states
    SeedLifecycleStage     # Seed state tracking
)
from esper.leyline.version import SchemaVersion  # Simple version validation
```

**Key Leyline Benefits**:
- **57% smaller messages** (280 bytes vs 655 bytes)
- **73% faster serialization** (<80Î¼s vs 300Î¼s) 
- **88% fewer GC allocations** (4 vs 32 per message)
- **Single source of truth** for all cross-subsystem contracts
