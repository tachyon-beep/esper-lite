## Executive Summary

This document presents the production-ready design for Jace (The Mind Sculptor), the 12th subsystem of the Esper morphogenetic platform, fully updated with all critical C-016 External Review fixes and integrated with Leyline (shared contracts) following Option B (Performance-First) standards. Jace provides intelligent curriculum coordination between Tamiyo's task-based curriculum and Simic's strategy-based curriculum, optimizing learning trajectories through sophisticated multi-objective optimization with comprehensive safety measures.

**Modularization Note:** This document has been split from a 2164-line monolithic design into 4 focused documents for maintainability and clarity. Each subdocument handles a specific architectural concern while maintaining complete cross-references.

**C-016 Integration Achievements:**
- **Circuit Breakers**: Replaced ALL assert statements with three-state circuit breakers
- **Realistic Timing**: Fixed <5ms coordination claims to realistic 18ms epoch boundary alignment
- **Memory Management**: Implemented TTL-based cleanup and bounded caches to prevent memory leaks
- **Leyline Integration**: Complete migration to shared contracts with no local duplicates
- **Conservative Mode**: Added fallback coordination under stress conditions
- **Chaos Engineering**: Comprehensive curriculum disruption testing framework
- **Property-Based Testing**: Mathematical guarantees for coordination consistency
- **SLO Framework**: Error budgets with conservative mode triggers

Named after the planeswalker who sculpts thoughts and strategies, Jace ensures that task complexity and strategy sophistication advance in harmony, maximizing learning effectiveness while preventing curriculum misalignment that could destabilize training.

## 1. Core Architecture Decision

### **Mediator Pattern with Multi-Objective Optimization**

- **Foundation**: Event-driven coordination service with circuit breaker protection
- **Optimization Model**: Pareto-optimal trajectory planning with chaos resilience
- **Integration Pattern**: Mediator between dual curriculum systems with conservative fallback
- **Deployment Model**: Lightweight service with hierarchical caching and memory management

## 2. Architectural Principles

### 2.1 Non-Negotiable Requirements

1. **Zero Breaking Changes**: Must not disrupt existing curriculum systems
2. **Coordination Effectiveness**: >90% appropriate strategy selection (SLO tracked)
3. **Low Latency**: 18ms coordination decisions (95th percentile, hardware-aware)
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Continue training with conservative mode if coordination unavailable
5. **Complete Audit Trail**: All coordination decisions logged with correlation IDs
6. **Minimal Overhead**: <2% additional training time (measured and budgeted)

### 2.2 Design Principles

1. **Mediator Pattern**: Central coordination without direct coupling
2. **Event-Driven**: Reactive to curriculum state changes with circuit breaker protection
3. **Multi-Objective Optimization**: Balance multiple competing goals with fallback
4. **Predictive Coordination**: Anticipate future curriculum states with conservative bounds
5. **Hierarchical Caching**: L1/L2/L3 cache with TTL-based cleanup
6. **[C-016] Circuit Breaker Protection**: All critical paths protected with fallback
7. **[C-016] Conservative Mode**: Automatic degradation when SLOs exceeded
