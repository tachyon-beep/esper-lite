## Blueprint Safety Data Sheet (BSDS) Specification

**Document ID:** ESP-BSDS-SPEC-V1-0
**Date:** 2025-09-10
**Author:** System Architecture Conclave
**Status:** Adopted Technical Specification
**Component:** Urabrask Evaluation Engine

### 1.0 Executive Summary

This document specifies the **Blueprint Safety Data Sheet (BSDS)**, a structured characterization format produced by the Urabrask evaluation engine for every blueprint it evaluates.

Given that Karn's generative NAS produces experimental blueprints with unknown and often problematic characteristics, the BSDS transforms Urabrask from a simple pass/fail validator into a sophisticated risk characterization system. This enables downstream controllers (particularly Tamiyo and Narset) to make nuanced, context-aware decisions about blueprint deployment rather than binary accept/reject choices.

The BSDS serves as a blueprint's "passport" through the Esper systemâ€”no blueprint generated by Karn may be considered by Tamiyo without first obtaining its BSDS from Urabrask's crucible.

### 2.0 BSDS Schema Definition

The Blueprint Safety Data Sheet is a structured artifact analogous to a chemical safety data sheet, providing comprehensive hazard identification, safe handling procedures, and performance characteristics.

#### 2.1 Standard Schema

| Section | Field | Description & Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Identification**| Blueprint ID | Unique Identifier. `BP091` |
| | Name | Human-readable name. `Gated Recurrent Attention` |
| | Overall Risk Score | Urabrask's ML-predicted risk. `0.85 (CRITICAL)` |
| **2. Hazard ID** | Gradient Instability | Tendency for gradients to explode/vanish. `HIGH: Tends toward vanishing gradients in networks > 16 layers.` |
| | Memory Consumption | Scaling behavior and memory usage. `CRITICAL: O(n^3) complexity. WARNING: May cause OOM for sequences > 512.`|
| | Numerical Stability | Sensitivity to floating-point precision. `MODERATE: Unstable with FP16; requires gradient clipping.` |
| | Performance Profile | Known performance weaknesses. `UNEVEN: High latency on small batches (< 32).` |
| **3. Safe Handling** | Rec. Grafting Strategy| Recommended Kasmina strategy. `DRIFT_CONTROLLED strongly advised.` |
| | Incompatible Arch. | Known bad combinations. `Do not stack > 2 layers. Unstable with standard RNNs.` |
| | Resource Requirements| Minimum resources for stable operation. `Requires 24GB VRAM. Grad clip norm=1.0.` |
| | Required Pairings | Necessary architectural pairings. `Must be paired with GeLU or Swish activation.` |
| **4. Performance**| Latency (p95) | Latency at a standard batch size. `22ms @ batch_size=64` |
| | Throughput | Throughput at a standard batch size. `4,100 tokens/sec @ batch_size=64` |
| | Memory Footprint | Peak memory usage during operation. `18.2GB @ batch_size=64` |
| | Compilation Time | Time to compile from blueprint to kernel. `4.3 seconds` |

#### 2.2 Risk Score Calculation

The Overall Risk Score (0.0-1.0) aggregates individual hazard assessments:

- `0.0-0.3`: LOW - Safe for automatic deployment
- `0.3-0.6`: MODERATE - Requires monitoring
- `0.6-0.8`: HIGH - Requires explicit approval and mitigation
- `0.8-1.0`: CRITICAL - Deploy only with specific justification and safeguards

**Example:** When Narset requests a scaffold deployment with `risk_score: 0.85`, this value comes directly from the BSDS Overall Risk Score field, allowing downstream budget allocations and safety protocols to be calibrated accordingly.

### 3.0 Integration Points

#### 3.1 Producer: Urabrask Crucible

Every blueprint from Karn MUST undergo evaluation in Urabrask's crucible, which:

1. Compiles the blueprint to an executable kernel
2. Runs standardized stress tests across multiple dimensions
3. Characterizes failure modes and resource consumption
4. Generates the complete BSDS before blueprint release

#### 3.2 Primary Consumers

**Tamiyo (Strategic Controller):**

- Uses BSDS risk scores in budget calculations: `AdaptationCost = w_risk * BSDS.OverallRiskScore + w_disruption * DisruptionScore`
- Makes contextual deployment decisions (e.g., accepting HIGH memory consumption risk when working with small, fixed-size inputs)
- Issues mitigation commands based on Safe Handling recommendations

**Narset (Tactical Controllers):**

- References BSDS when requesting scaffolds or seeds
- Applies recommended grafting strategies and resource allocations
- Monitors for hazards identified in the BSDS during deployment

**Simic (Learning System):**

- Correlates actual failures with BSDS predictions to improve future risk assessment
- Learns patterns like "blueprints with CRITICAL memory warnings fail 73% of the time on sequences >256"
- Provides feedback to improve Urabrask's hazard prediction models

### 4.0 Operational Requirements

#### 4.1 Mandatory Evaluation

No blueprint may bypass Urabrask evaluation. The BSDS serves as the mandatory "passport" for any blueprint to enter the adaptation pipeline.

#### 4.2 Immutability

Once generated, a BSDS is immutable. If a blueprint is modified, it receives a new Blueprint ID and requires complete re-evaluation.

#### 4.3 Retention

BSDS records must be retained for all deployed blueprints throughout their lifecycle, plus a minimum retention period for audit and learning purposes.

### 5.0 Extended Schema (Optional Fields)

Future versions may include:

- **Behavioral Characteristics:** Impact on model behavior (e.g., "Increases feature sparsity by 15-20%")
- **Compatibility Matrix:** Detailed interactions with specific model architectures
- **Degradation Profile:** How performance degrades under various failure conditions
- **Historical Performance:** Success/failure rates from previous deployments

---

### 6.0 Implementation Notes

- The crucible test suite must be deterministic and reproducible
- Hazard thresholds should be calibrated per model family and scale
- The ML risk predictor should be retrained periodically with Simic's feedback
- Emergency overrides may bypass BSDS requirements but must be logged and escalated
