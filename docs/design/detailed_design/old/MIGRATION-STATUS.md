# Architecture Documentation Migration Status Register

## Overview

This register tracks which architecture documents have been successfully migrated to the new template format and are "locked" (validated and trustworthy). Documents not in this register may still be in the old format or have quality issues from automated migration attempts.

## Migration Status Key

- **üîí LOCKED**: Fully migrated, validated, and production-ready in new template format
- **‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL**: Partially migrated, may have issues (e.g., Gemini's problematic migrations)
- **üìù PENDING**: Not yet migrated to new template format
- **üö´ FAILED**: Migration attempted but failed validation

## Migration Guidelines

### To Lock a Document

1. **Validate Source**: Ensure all source content is identified
2. **Perform Migration**: Use appropriate templates
3. **Validation Check**: Have validation-specialist verify:
   - No missing content
   - No hallucinated content
   - Technical accuracy preserved
   - Proper template structure
4. **Create Certificate**: Document validation results
5. **Update Register**: Mark as LOCKED with details

### Known Issues with Gemini Migrations

Based on Simic validation, Gemini migrations may have:
- **Deleted Implementation Details**: Removed 50%+ of content in some cases
- **Lost Safety Mechanisms**: C-016 features reduced to mentions
- **Missing Code Examples**: Implementation code deleted
- **Shallow Summaries**: Detailed docs reduced to overviews

All Gemini-migrated documents (marked ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL) should be validated before trusting.

## Next Priority

Recommend validating and potentially re-migrating:
1. Tolaria (01) - Core training orchestrator
2. Kasmina (02) - Already has C-022 updates but needs base validation
3. Tamiyo (03) - Strategic controller critical for system
