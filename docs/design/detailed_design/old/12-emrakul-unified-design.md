## Executive Summary

Emrakul provides strategic parameter pruning coordination for the Esper morphogenetic platform using a checkpoint-based "measure twice, cut once" approach. Following C-020 conclave consensus, this subsystem operates offline during checkpoint saves, eliminating runtime performance constraints while enabling sophisticated analysis. The paradigm shift from runtime to checkpoint-based pruning transforms parameter removal from a complex distributed systems problem into an elegant offline analysis task.

Key characteristics:
- **Checkpoint-Based Operation**: Offline analysis during checkpoint saves with unlimited compute budget
- **"Measure Twice, Cut Once"**: Comprehensive importance analysis before irreversible parameter removal
- **Zero Runtime Impact**: No training disruption or performance overhead during execution
- **Natural Synchronization**: Leverages checkpoint boundaries for coordination without complex protocols
- **Enhanced Structured Pruning**: Coordinate checkpoint-based structural pruning operations across Kasmina, Elesh, and Urabrask

**IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION**: Current implementation performs **logical pruning** (masking) only. Parameters are masked but not physically removed. No performance benefits expected until Phase 2 physical compaction is implemented.

## Core Architecture Decision

### **Checkpoint-Based Strategic Coordination**

- **Foundation**: Offline importance aggregation with checkpoint-aligned execution
- **Integration Model**: Subordinate to Tamiyo, coordinates Elesh workers, executes via Kasmina checkpoint pipeline
- **Authority Model**: Owns global pruning strategy during checkpoint save windows
- **Deployment Model**: Single instance activated during checkpoint operations

## Architectural Principles

### Non-Negotiable Requirements

1. **Zero Training Disruption**: All analysis occurs offline during checkpoint saves
2. **Conservative Safety**: "Measure twice, cut once" - comprehensive validation before removal
3. **Simple Rollback**: Checkpoint restoration replaces complex runtime rollback

### Design Principles

1. **Offline Analysis**: Unlimited compute budget for sophisticated importance calculations
2. **Natural Coordination**: Checkpoint boundaries provide synchronization without protocols
3. **Gradient Isolation Preservation**: Maintains invariant ∇L_host ∩ ∇L_seed = ∅

### Production Safety Principles

1. **Comprehensive Validation**: Offline analysis enables complete safety verification
2. **Non-Blocking Failure**: System continues training without pruning if analysis fails
3. **Checkpoint Integrity**: Pruning decisions embedded in checkpoint for consistency

## Core Responsibilities

### Primary Coordination Responsibilities

1. **Strategic Pruning Analysis**: Analyze accumulated importance statistics from Kasmina
2. **Offline Worker Coordination**: Coordinate Elesh workers for parallel analysis
3. **Safety Validation**: Comprehensive pre-application validation before mask generation
4. **Checkpoint Integration**: Embed pruning decisions in checkpoint save/load cycle

### Enhanced Structured Pruning Responsibilities

**Coordinate checkpoint-based structural pruning operations**
- Orchestrate comprehensive offline analysis during checkpoint saves with unlimited compute budget
- Coordinate multi-worker parallel analysis of channel importance, attention head redundancy, and layer significance
- Manage analysis timing within 2-5 minute checkpoint windows with hard timeout protections
- Ensure zero disruption to main training loop through checkpoint boundary synchronization

**Orchestrate pruning decisions across Kasmina, Elesh, and Urabrask**
- Receive importance statistics from Kasmina at checkpoint boundaries
- Coordinate Elesh workers for parallel structured analysis (channels, attention heads, layers)
- Send analysis requests to Elesh with comprehensive configuration and safety constraints
- Validate analysis results from Elesh before generating final pruning decisions
- Coordinate with Urabrask for safety validation of proposed structural changes
- Send validated pruning masks to Kasmina for application during checkpoint load

**Manage progressive pruning schedules**
- Implement two-phase progressive schedule management
- Phase 1 (Epochs 1-30): Pure validation mode with importance tracking only
- Phase 2 (Epochs 31+): Active pruning with conservative → moderate → aggressive progression
- Dynamic threshold adjustment based on model stability and accuracy retention
- Automatic schedule progression with safety constraints and rollback triggers

**Handle rollback coordination for failed pruning attempts**
- Coordinate atomic rollback across all subsystems when pruning validation fails
- Manage checkpoint restoration with integrity validation
- Implement progressive rollback strategies (immediate → previous checkpoint → safe state)
- Track rollback attempts and implement circuit breakers for repeated failures
- Coordinate cross-system state synchronization after rollback completion

## Logical vs Physical Pruning Implementation

### Phase 1: Logical Pruning (Current Implementation)

### Current Implementation Status

**✅ PHASE 1 IMPLEMENTED**: Logical pruning with parameter masking coordination
**⏳ PHASE 2 PLANNED**: Physical pruning with actual parameter removal coordination

Emrakul currently coordinates the generation and application of parameter masks. This provides no immediate performance benefits but validates the entire pruning pipeline before more aggressive physical compaction is attempted.

- `leyline.CheckpointMetadata` - Checkpoint coordination and metadata
- `leyline.TelemetryEvent` - Analysis performance and health metrics

**BLOCKING ISSUE #2 RESOLVED**: All pruning messages now include idempotency keys for replay safety.

For complete contract definitions, see: `/docs/architecture/00-leyline-shared-contracts.md`

## Performance Targets

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Checkpoint Overhead | 2-5 minutes | Additional time for 1B parameters |
| Analysis Accuracy | <5% error rate | Importance estimation quality |
| Memory Usage During Analysis | <2GB | Peak memory for offline processing |
| Logical Pruning Rate Achievement | 1-3% actual | Conservative but measurable parameter masking |
| Rollback Latency | <30 seconds | Checkpoint restore time |

*Note: Checkpoint overhead is "barely tolerable" and optimization remains a priority for future phases.*

**IMPORTANT**: Phase 1 logical pruning provides **no memory or speed benefits**. Performance improvements will come in Phase 2 with physical compaction.

## Structured Pruning Coordination

### Checkpoint-Based Architecture

**Implementation**: Checkpoint-based "measure twice, cut once" approach with comprehensive offline analysis

**Core Phases**:
1. **Importance Collection**: Kasmina exports gradient statistics at checkpoint boundaries
2. **Offline Analysis**: Emrakul coordinates Elesh workers for comprehensive analysis (2-5 minutes)
3. **Safety Validation**: Urabrask validates all proposed structural changes
4. **Conservative Application**: Kasmina applies validated masks with simple rollback capability

**Coordination Benefits**:
- **Unlimited Compute Budget**: Offline analysis removes runtime performance constraints
- **Natural Synchronization**: Checkpoint boundaries eliminate complex coordination protocols
- **Simple Rollback**: Checkpoint restoration replaces complex runtime rollback mechanisms
- **Conservative Safety**: Comprehensive validation before any irreversible changes

### Message Flow Orchestration

**Primary Coordination Sequence**:
```
1. Kasmina exports importance statistics at checkpoint boundary
2. Emrakul receives statistics and initiates analysis phase
3. Emrakul coordinates parallel Elesh workers for structured analysis
4. Elesh analyzes channels, attention heads, and layers independently
5. Emrakul aggregates analysis results and generates pruning decisions
6. Emrakul sends decisions to Urabrask for safety validation
7. Urabrask validates structural integrity and accuracy retention
8. Emrakul sends validated masks to Kasmina for application
9. Kasmina applies masks and saves checkpoint with pruning metadata
```

**Timing Constraints**:
- **Analysis Window**: 2-5 minutes during checkpoint pause
- **Hard Timeout**: 5 minutes maximum (circuit breaker protection)
- **Worker Coordination**: 30-second timeouts for individual analysis requests
- **Validation Phase**: 60-second timeout for Urabrask safety checks

**Failure Handling**:
- **Analysis Timeout**: Skip pruning cycle, continue training without modification
- **Validation Failure**: Automatic rollback to previous checkpoint state
- **Worker Failure**: Continue with reduced worker count or abort analysis
- **Communication Failure**: Fall back to previous pruning strategy or skip cycle

### Rollback Management

**Rollback Triggers**:
- Urabrask safety validation failure (accuracy drop >2%)
- Analysis timeout exceeding hard limits
- Structural integrity validation failure
- Repeated worker coordination failures (3+ consecutive)

**Rollback Strategies**:
```python
class EmrakulRollbackCoordination:
    """Coordinate rollback across all subsystems"""

    def coordinate_immediate_rollback(self, checkpoint_id: str):
        """Immediate rollback to last known good state"""
        # 1. Signal all subsystems to pause operations
        # 2. Restore checkpoint with validated state
        # 3. Verify integrity across all components
        # 4. Resume training with previous configuration

    def coordinate_progressive_rollback(self, rollback_depth: int):
        """Progressive rollback through multiple checkpoints"""
        # 1. Try most recent checkpoint first
        # 2. If validation fails, try previous checkpoint
        # 3. Continue until valid state found or safety limit reached
        # 4. Emergency fallback to known good baseline

    def coordinate_atomic_rollback(self, failed_operation: str):
        """Atomic rollback of specific operation"""
        # 1. Identify exact failure point in coordination sequence
        # 2. Reverse only the failed operation without full rollback
        # 3. Validate consistency after partial rollback
        # 4. Resume from corrected state
```

**Cross-System Coordination**:
- **Kasmina Coordination**: Restore importance tracking state and clear failed masks
- **Elesh Coordination**: Cancel in-progress analysis and reset worker states
- **Urabrask Coordination**: Clear failed validation state and reset safety monitors
- **Tamiyo Coordination**: Update strategic parameters and reset pruning schedule

**Recovery Validation**:
- **State Consistency**: Verify all subsystems return to coherent state
- **Model Integrity**: Validate model parameters and architecture consistency
- **Training Continuity**: Ensure training can resume without disruption
- **Telemetry Consistency**: Verify metrics and monitoring return to valid state

## Operational Considerations

### Health Monitoring

- **Health Check Endpoint**: `/health/emrakul`
- **Key Metrics**: checkpoint_overhead, analysis_success_rate, logical_pruning_effectiveness, validation_time, structured_pruning_coverage
- **SLO Targets**: 95% successful analysis, <5 min checkpoint overhead, <1% training time impact

### Failure Modes

| Failure Mode | Detection | Response |
|--------------|-----------|----------|
| Analysis Timeout | >5 minutes without completion | Skip pruning, save checkpoint without masks (non-blocking) |
| Memory Exhaustion | Analysis process OOM | Terminate analysis gracefully, log for optimization |
| Importance Data Corruption | Validation failure during analysis | Use previous checkpoint's strategy, continue training |
| Mask Application Error | Checkpoint load failure | Restore previous checkpoint automatically |
| Structured Pruning Failure | Elesh analysis timeout or error | Fall back to basic importance-based pruning |
| Cross-System Coordination Failure | Message timeout or protocol error | Abort current pruning cycle, resume normal training |

### Scaling Considerations

- **Horizontal Scaling**: Not applicable (checkpoint-synchronized single instance)
- **Vertical Scaling**: 16 CPU cores, 32GB RAM for 10B parameters (offline analysis intensive)
- **Resource Requirements**: CPU and memory bound during analysis, no GPU usage
- **Worker Scaling**: Uses formula W ≥ ceil(P / (R × T)) for Elesh worker coordination

## Security Considerations

- **Authentication**: Internal service mesh only, activated during checkpoint windows
- **Authorization**: Analysis triggered only by valid Kasmina checkpoint operations
- **Data Protection**: Importance statistics encrypted at rest in checkpoints
- **Audit**: All pruning decisions logged with complete analysis rationale
- **Idempotency**: BLOCKING ISSUE #2 FIXED - All operations are idempotent with replay safety

## Migration Notes

> **Migration Status**: Version 3.0 - Enhanced structured pruning integration
> - **C-020 Conclave** (2025-01-14): Enhanced structured pruning capabilities
> - **Runtime Constraints**: Eliminated through offline operation
> - **RemovalProxy**: No longer needed - replaced by checkpoint pipeline integration
> - **Performance Targets**: Adjusted for offline analysis with acceptable checkpoint overhead
> - **Blocking Issues**: All 7 critical issues resolved (UUIDs, idempotency, Count-Min, device/dtype, logical/physical distinction, accuracy metrics, worker scaling)
