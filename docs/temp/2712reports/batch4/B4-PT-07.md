## Summary

**One-line summary:** `TamiyoRolloutStep` NamedTuple is defined but the buffer stores directly into tensors - verify if needed.

**Category:**
- [ ] Correctness bug
- [ ] Race condition / concurrency
- [ ] Memory leak / resource issue
- [ ] Performance bottleneck
- [ ] Numerical stability
- [ ] torch.compile compatibility
- [x] Dead code / unwired functionality
- [ ] API design / contract violation
- [ ] Test coverage gap
- [ ] Documentation / naming
- [ ] Defensive programming violation
- [ ] Legacy code policy violation

## Detailed Description

### What's Wrong

A `TamiyoRolloutStep` NamedTuple is defined for rollout steps, but the buffer implementation stores data directly into pre-allocated tensors rather than using this type.

### Investigation Needed

- Is `TamiyoRolloutStep` used externally (e.g., in tests or callers)?
- Is it intended for documentation/type hints?
- Should it be removed if unused?

---

## Recommended Fix

1. Search for usages:
```bash
grep -rn "TamiyoRolloutStep" src/ tests/
```

2. If unused, remove it (per No Legacy Code Policy)
3. If used externally, keep it
4. If intended for documentation, add a comment:
```python
# NOTE: TamiyoRolloutStep defines the logical structure of a rollout step.
# The buffer stores these fields in pre-allocated tensors for efficiency,
# but this NamedTuple documents the expected interface.
```

## Verification

### How to Verify the Fix

- [ ] Search for usages of TamiyoRolloutStep
- [ ] Remove if unused, or document if kept intentionally

## Cross-Review (DRL Specialist)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Verdict** | `ENDORSE` |
| **Reviewer** | DRL Specialist |

**Evaluation:** TamiyoRolloutStep is exported in `simic/agent/__init__.py:12` and listed in `__all__`, suggesting intentional public API status. The NamedTuple serves as interface documentation - consumers could use it to understand expected transition structure even though the buffer stores tensors directly. Keep it, but add a docstring note explaining it documents the logical schema. No RL training implications - purely API hygiene.

## Cross-Review (PyTorch Specialist)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Verdict** | `NEUTRAL` |
| **Reviewer** | PyTorch Specialist |
| **Date** | 2024-12-27 |

**Evaluation:** `TamiyoRolloutStep` serves as API documentation and type contract. The docstring correctly notes "Uses flat NamedTuple for torch.compile compatibility" (line 41). While the buffer stores into pre-allocated tensors for performance, the NamedTuple pattern is common in PyTorch RL (cf. SB3's RolloutBufferSamples). Recommend keeping with enhanced docstring: "Type contract for buffer fields; not instantiated in hot path."
