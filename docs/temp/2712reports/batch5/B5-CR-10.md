## Summary

**One-line summary:** Empty `if TYPE_CHECKING: pass` blocks add clutter.

**Category:**
- [ ] Correctness bug
- [ ] Race condition / concurrency
- [ ] Memory leak / resource issue
- [ ] Performance bottleneck
- [ ] Numerical stability
- [ ] torch.compile compatibility
- [x] Dead code / unwired functionality
- [ ] API design / contract violation
- [ ] Test coverage gap
- [ ] Documentation / naming
- [ ] Defensive programming violation
- [ ] Legacy code policy violation

---

## Detailed Description

### What's Wrong

Both files have:

```python
if TYPE_CHECKING:
    pass
```

This is dead code - the block does nothing.

---

## Recommended Fix

Remove the empty blocks:

```python
# Remove this entirely:
# if TYPE_CHECKING:
#     pass
```

---

## Verification

### How to Verify the Fix

- [ ] Remove empty TYPE_CHECKING blocks from both files
- [ ] Verify no import errors

---

## Related Findings

None.

## Cross-Review (PyTorch Specialist)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Verdict** | `ENDORSE` |
| **Reviewer** | PyTorch Specialist |
| **Date** | 2024-12-27 |

**Evaluation:** Empty TYPE_CHECKING blocks are pure clutter with no functional or typing benefit. These likely resulted from LLM-generated boilerplate or copy-paste from a template. Removing them has zero risk and marginally improves readability. No PyTorch-specific concerns.

## Cross-Review (DRL Specialist)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Verdict** | `NEUTRAL` |
| **Reviewer** | DRL Specialist |

**Evaluation:** This is purely a code hygiene issue with no RL implications. Empty TYPE_CHECKING blocks are harmless dead code, likely left over from refactoring when type imports were removed. Cleaning them up is fine but low priority. No impact on training correctness or performance.

| **Verdict** | `ENDORSE` |
| **Reviewer** | Code Review Specialist |

**Evaluation:** Verified both files contain `if TYPE_CHECKING: pass` blocks at lines 29-30 that serve no purpose. These are dead code - TYPE_CHECKING blocks are meant to contain type-only imports to avoid circular imports at runtime, but empty blocks with just `pass` add visual clutter without providing any type checking benefit. Simple removal is the correct fix per the project's no-legacy-code policy which mandates deletion of unused code.
