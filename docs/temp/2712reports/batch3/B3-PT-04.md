## Summary

**One-line summary:** `expand_as()` creates an unnecessary view when PyTorch broadcasting handles the operation natively.

**Category:**
- [ ] Correctness bug
- [ ] Race condition / concurrency
- [ ] Memory leak / resource issue
- [x] Performance bottleneck
- [ ] Numerical stability
- [ ] torch.compile compatibility
- [ ] Dead code / unwired functionality
- [ ] API design / contract violation
- [ ] Test coverage gap
- [ ] Documentation / naming
- [ ] Defensive programming violation
- [ ] Legacy code policy violation

## Detailed Description

### What's Wrong

The SE attention block uses `expand_as()` to match tensor shapes before multiplication, but this is unnecessary. PyTorch broadcasting automatically handles `(B, C, 1, 1)` against `(B, C, H, W)`.

### Code Evidence

```python
# /home/john/esper-lite/src/esper/kasmina/blueprints/cnn.py:161

return x * y.expand_as(x)
```

### Why This Matters

- `expand_as()` creates a view that can cause issues under certain memory layouts
- Unnecessary operation in the forward path
- Minor performance overhead

---

## Recommended Fix

```python
return x * y  # Broadcasting handles (B,C,1,1) * (B,C,H,W) automatically
```

---

## Verification

### How to Verify the Fix

- [ ] Verify output equivalence with and without expand_as
- [ ] Check memory layout compatibility (contiguous vs channels_last)
- [ ] Profile forward pass time

## Related Findings

## Cross-Review

**Code Review Evaluation:** Technically correct but low-impact. The `expand_as()` creates a strided view (zero-copy), and modern TorchInductor typically elides it during fusion. Worth fixing for code clarity, but unlikely to yield measurable performance gains.

**DRL Evaluation:** Minimal DRL training impact. SE attention recalibration is a cheap operation and `expand_as()` creates a view (zero-copy) not a new allocation. TorchInductor typically fuses this pattern regardless. The fix is correct but low-priority; if channels_last memory format is used, verify broadcasting semantics remain identical before changing.

**PyTorch Expert Evaluation:** Negligible impact. `expand_as()` returns a strided view (no memory allocation) and TorchInductor fuses `x * y.expand_as(x)` identically to `x * y` under `torch.compile`. The explicit expand documents intent for the SE-block pattern. Low priority; fix only if cleaning up codebase stylistically.
