## Summary

**One-line summary:** `SeedStageChangedPayload` construction is repeated ~8 times with nearly identical code.

**Category:**
- [ ] Correctness bug
- [ ] Race condition / concurrency
- [ ] Memory leak / resource issue
- [ ] Performance bottleneck
- [ ] Numerical stability
- [ ] torch.compile compatibility
- [ ] Dead code / unwired functionality
- [ ] API design / contract violation
- [ ] Test coverage gap
- [x] Documentation / naming
- [ ] Defensive programming violation
- [ ] Legacy code policy violation

## Detailed Description

### What's Wrong

The `SeedStageChangedPayload` and related telemetry constructions are duplicated across multiple lifecycle methods. This violates DRY and risks inconsistency if payload structure changes.

### Code Evidence

```python
# Repeated in multiple methods:
payload = SeedStageChangedPayload(
    env_id=-1,
    slot_index=self.slot_index,
    old_stage=old_stage,
    new_stage=new_stage,
    # ... many more fields
)
```

### Why This Matters

- Changes to payload structure require updates in 8+ places
- Risk of field inconsistency between emission sites
- Code bloat in already large file (~2600 lines)

---

## Recommended Fix

Extract a helper method for stage change telemetry:

```python
def _emit_stage_change_telemetry(
    self,
    old_stage: SeedStage,
    new_stage: SeedStage,
    trigger: str,
    **extra_fields: Any
) -> None:
    payload = SeedStageChangedPayload(
        env_id=-1,
        slot_index=self.slot_index,
        old_stage=old_stage,
        new_stage=new_stage,
        # ... common fields
        **extra_fields
    )
    self._emit_telemetry_with_callback(payload)
```

---

## Verification

### How to Verify the Fix

- [ ] Verify all telemetry emission points use the helper
- [ ] Run telemetry tests to ensure payloads unchanged
- [ ] Check Nissa integration still receives correct events

## Cross-Review: DRL Specialist

| Verdict | **ENDORSE** |
|---------|-------------|

**Evaluation:** Telemetry consistency is critical for RL debugging and reward engineering. Inconsistent payload construction across 8 emission sites risks silent telemetry drift that corrupts training analysis (e.g., missing fields break Karn dashboards mid-run). Given that CLAUDE.md explicitly prohibits deferring telemetry work, this is a legitimate P3 cleanup that prevents future debugging pain.

## Cross-Review: PyTorch Specialist

| Verdict | **ENDORSE** |
|---------|-------------|

**Evaluation:** Clear DRY violation with 7+ identical payload constructions (lines 1426, 1521, 1626, 1709, 2323, 2371, 2415). The helper method proposal is sound and would reduce ~150 lines of boilerplate while centralizing the conditional gradient health fields logic.

## Cross-Review: Code Review Specialist

| Verdict | **ENDORSE** |
|---------|-------------|

**Evaluation:** Confirmed 7 instances of SeedStageChangedPayload construction (lines 1426, 1521, 1626, 1709, 2323, 2371, 2415). Each shares identical boilerplate: slot_id, env_id sentinel, and identical conditional patterns for grad_ratio/has_vanishing/has_exploding fields. Extracting a helper method would reduce ~175 lines of repetition and eliminate field-consistency risk. Worth addressing.
