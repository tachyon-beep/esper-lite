## Summary

**One-line summary:** LSTM health monitoring has no test coverage despite detecting critical training failures.

**Category:**
- [ ] Correctness bug
- [ ] Race condition / concurrency
- [ ] Memory leak / resource issue
- [ ] Performance bottleneck
- [ ] Numerical stability
- [ ] torch.compile compatibility
- [ ] Dead code / unwired functionality
- [ ] API design / contract violation
- [x] Test coverage gap
- [ ] Documentation / naming
- [ ] Defensive programming violation
- [ ] Legacy code policy violation

## Detailed Description

### What's Wrong

`LSTMHealthMetrics` and `compute_lstm_health()` monitor:
1. Hidden state magnitude (explosion/vanishing)
2. NaN/Inf propagation in hidden states
3. Cell state health

Grep shows NO tests exist:
```bash
grep -r "LSTMHealthMetrics\|compute_lstm_health" tests/
# No results
```

**DRL Importance:** Hidden state drift is a common LSTM failure mode (Pascanu et al., 2013):
- Exploding hidden states cause NaN losses
- Vanishing hidden states lose temporal information
- Both are detectable before catastrophic failure with monitoring

---

## Recommended Fix

Add tests for edge cases:

```python
# tests/simic/telemetry/test_lstm_health.py

class TestLSTMHealthMetrics:
    def test_healthy_hidden_state(self):
        h = torch.randn(1, 32, 512)  # Normal magnitudes
        c = torch.randn(1, 32, 512)
        metrics = compute_lstm_health((h, c))
        assert metrics.is_healthy()

    def test_exploding_hidden_state(self):
        h = torch.randn(1, 32, 512) * 1000  # Huge magnitudes
        c = torch.randn(1, 32, 512)
        metrics = compute_lstm_health((h, c))
        assert not metrics.is_healthy()

    def test_nan_detection(self):
        h = torch.randn(1, 32, 512)
        h[0, 0, 0] = float('nan')
        c = torch.randn(1, 32, 512)
        metrics = compute_lstm_health((h, c))
        assert metrics.has_nan

    def test_vanishing_hidden_state(self):
        h = torch.randn(1, 32, 512) * 1e-8  # Tiny magnitudes
        c = torch.randn(1, 32, 512)
        metrics = compute_lstm_health((h, c))
        assert not metrics.is_healthy()
```

## Verification

### How to Verify the Fix

- [ ] Create test_lstm_health.py
- [ ] Test healthy, exploding, vanishing, NaN, Inf cases
- [ ] Achieve >90% coverage for lstm_health.py

## Cross-Review (DRL Specialist)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Verdict** | `REFINE` |
| **Reviewer** | DRL Specialist |

**Evaluation:** Same pattern as B7-PT-04 - compute_lstm_health() is never called. LSTM health is critical (Pascanu et al., 2013) but testing unwired functionality is lower priority. Should check health after policy.get_action() and policy.update(). Tests should cover gradual drift and batch variation.

## Cross-Review (PyTorch Specialist)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Verdict** | `ENDORSE` |
| **Reviewer** | PyTorch Specialist |

**Evaluation:** Confirmed no test coverage. LSTM health monitoring catches hidden state issues before NaN losses. Code at lines 89-111 shows good PyTorch practice (single sync). Edge cases needed: NaN propagation, vanishing/exploding states, device transfer.

## Cross-Review (Code Review Specialist)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Verdict** | `REFINE` |
| **Reviewer** | Code Review Specialist |

**Evaluation:** Confirmed: exported but never called. Component is well-implemented but unwired. Per CLAUDE.md telemetry guidance: wire first, then test. **Downgrade to P3** - same priority adjustment as B7-PT-04.
