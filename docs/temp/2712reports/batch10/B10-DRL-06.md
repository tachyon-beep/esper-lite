## Summary

**One-line summary:** Protocol requires `compile()` method but doesn't specify what happens if torch.compile fails.

**Category:**
- [ ] Correctness bug
- [ ] Race condition / concurrency
- [ ] Memory leak / resource issue
- [ ] Performance bottleneck
- [ ] Numerical stability
- [ ] torch.compile compatibility
- [ ] Dead code / unwired functionality
- [x] API design / contract violation
- [ ] Test coverage gap
- [x] Documentation / naming
- [ ] Defensive programming violation
- [ ] Legacy code policy violation

## Detailed Description

### What's Wrong

The `PolicyBundle` protocol defines a `compile()` method:

```python
def compile(self, mode: str = "default") -> None:
    """Compile the policy with torch.compile.

    Args:
        mode: Compilation mode ("default", "reduce-overhead", etc.)
    """
    ...
```

Missing documentation:
1. What happens if compilation fails?
2. Should implementations catch and handle errors or let them propagate?
3. Should `is_compiled` return True if compile was attempted but failed?
4. Is calling compile() twice an error, no-op, or undefined?

### Impact

- **Low severity**: Documentation issue
- **Implementation variance**: Different implementations may handle failures differently
- **Debugging**: Unclear error behavior complicates troubleshooting

---

## Recommended Fix

Add comprehensive documentation:

```python
def compile(self, mode: str = "default") -> None:
    """Compile the policy with torch.compile.

    Compilation is idempotent - calling compile() multiple times is safe
    and has no effect after the first successful compilation.

    If compilation fails:
    - RuntimeError: Let propagate (indicates incompatible code)
    - is_compiled should return False (compilation did not succeed)

    Implementations should NOT catch compilation errors silently.
    The caller is responsible for handling failures (e.g., falling back
    to eager mode).

    Args:
        mode: Compilation mode. Valid values:
            - "default": Balanced compilation
            - "reduce-overhead": Faster compilation, may graph break more
            - "max-autotune": Slower compilation, better performance

    Raises:
        RuntimeError: If compilation fails due to incompatible operations.
    """
    ...
```

## Verification

### How to Verify the Fix

- [ ] Add docstring specifying compile failure semantics
- [ ] Verify LSTMPolicyBundle.compile() follows the contract
- [ ] Add test for compile failure behavior
