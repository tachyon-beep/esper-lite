## Summary

**One-line summary:** `.contiguous()` call after attention transpose may be unnecessary with modern FlexAttention in PyTorch 2.9.

**Category:**
- [ ] Correctness bug
- [ ] Race condition / concurrency
- [ ] Memory leak / resource issue
- [x] Performance bottleneck
- [ ] Numerical stability
- [ ] torch.compile compatibility
- [ ] Dead code / unwired functionality
- [ ] API design / contract violation
- [ ] Test coverage gap
- [ ] Documentation / naming
- [ ] Defensive programming violation
- [ ] Legacy code policy violation

## Detailed Description

### What's Wrong

The `y.transpose(1, 2).contiguous().view(B, T, C)` at L250 forces a memory copy. Modern FlexAttention in PyTorch 2.9+ may handle non-contiguous inputs efficiently.

### Code Evidence

```python
# /home/john/esper-lite/src/esper/kasmina/host.py:250

y = y.transpose(1, 2).contiguous().view(B, T, C)
```

### Why This Is Currently Correct

Keeping `.contiguous()` ensures correctness across all SDPA backends (FlashAttention, Memory-Efficient, Math). Different backends have different contiguity requirements.

---

## Recommended Fix

### Low Priority Investigation

1. Benchmark with and without `.contiguous()` on target PyTorch version
2. Test across all SDPA backends
3. If all backends handle non-contiguous inputs, remove the call

For now, leave as-is for correctness.

## Verification

### How to Verify the Fix

- [ ] Profile memory allocations in attention forward pass
- [ ] Test correctness across SDPA backends without `.contiguous()`
- [ ] Verify with `torch.compile(fullgraph=True)`

## Cross-Review

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Reviewer** | `drl` |
| **Verdict** | `NEUTRAL` |

**Evaluation:** Correctness is paramount for gradient flow through attention in RL value/policy networks; `.contiguous()` is cheap insurance.
Benchmarking is worthwhile but should not compromise training stability -- defer unless profiling shows this as a hotspot.
