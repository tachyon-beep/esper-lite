## Summary

**One-line summary:** `@functools.cached_property` on segment info depends on `injection_specs()` - if host is modified after init, caches become stale.

**Category:**
- [ ] Correctness bug
- [ ] Race condition / concurrency
- [ ] Memory leak / resource issue
- [ ] Performance bottleneck
- [ ] Numerical stability
- [ ] torch.compile compatibility
- [ ] Dead code / unwired functionality
- [x] API design / contract violation
- [ ] Test coverage gap
- [ ] Documentation / naming
- [ ] Defensive programming violation
- [ ] Legacy code policy violation

## Detailed Description

### What's Wrong

`segment_channels` and `_segment_to_block` use `@functools.cached_property` but depend on `injection_specs()`. If the host is modified after init (e.g., blocks added/removed dynamically), cached values become stale.

### Code Evidence

```python
# /home/john/esper-lite/src/esper/kasmina/host.py:102-118

@functools.cached_property
def segment_channels(self) -> list[int]:
    """Channel count at each injection point."""
    return [spec.channels for spec in self.injection_specs()]

@functools.cached_property
def _segment_to_block(self) -> dict[int, int]:
    """Map segment index to block index."""
    return {spec.segment: i for i, spec in enumerate(self.injection_specs())}
```

### Current Mitigation

The HostProtocol doesn't support dynamic block modification - hosts are assumed immutable after construction. This is safe in current usage.

---

## Recommended Fix

Document the immutability assumption:

```python
@functools.cached_property
def segment_channels(self) -> list[int]:
    """Channel count at each injection point.

    INVARIANT: Host blocks must not be modified after construction.
    Cached value becomes stale if self.blocks is modified.
    """
```

---

## Verification

### How to Verify the Fix

- [ ] Add test verifying cache matches injection_specs
- [ ] Document immutability in HostProtocol

## Cross-Review

| Agent | Verdict | Evaluation |
|-------|---------|------------|
| **PyTorch** | NEUTRAL | cached_property on nn.Module is fine for torch.compile since Dynamo traces the cached value, not the property lookup. Immutability assumption is sound for frozen pretrained hosts. Low priority - document invariant as suggested, no PyTorch-specific concerns. |
| **CodeReview** | NEUTRAL | The immutability assumption is reasonable and matches PyTorch nn.Module conventions. Documentation is sufficient; adding invalidation machinery would over-engineer for a non-issue in practice. |
| **DRL** | NEUTRAL | Host immutability is architecturally enforced in current usage - seeds inject into a frozen host network. The cached segment/channel mappings define injection point topology which must remain stable during a training run; stale caches would break seed-to-host credit assignment, but the invariant holds today. |
