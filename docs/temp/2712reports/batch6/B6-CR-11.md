## Summary

**One-line summary:** Docstring lists parameters in a different order than the function signature.

**Category:**
- [ ] Correctness bug
- [ ] Race condition / concurrency
- [ ] Memory leak / resource issue
- [ ] Performance bottleneck
- [ ] Numerical stability
- [ ] torch.compile compatibility
- [ ] Dead code / unwired functionality
- [ ] API design / contract violation
- [ ] Test coverage gap
- [x] Documentation / naming
- [ ] Defensive programming violation
- [ ] Legacy code policy violation

## Detailed Description

### What's Wrong

The docstring for `compute_contribution_reward` lists parameters in a different order than they appear in the function signature. This makes cross-referencing harder when reading documentation.

---

## Recommended Fix

Reorder docstring Args section to match function signature order.

---

## Verification

### How to Verify the Fix

- [ ] Reorder docstring to match signature
- [ ] No functional change

---

## Related Findings

None.

## Cross-Review (PyTorch Specialist)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Verdict** | `NEUTRAL` |
| **Reviewer** | PyTorch Specialist |
| **Date** | 2024-12-27 |

**Evaluation:** This is a pure documentation issue with no PyTorch implications. The Simic Rewards module operates on Python floats, not tensors, so docstring ordering has no impact on numerical stability, torch.compile compatibility, or performance. The fix is trivial and low-risk.

## Cross-Review (DRL Specialist)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Verdict** | `NEUTRAL` |
| **Reviewer** | DRL Specialist |

**Evaluation:** This is a documentation-only issue with no impact on reward correctness, PBRS guarantees, or credit assignment. Parameter order mismatch in docstrings does not affect the RL training loop or policy optimization. While good documentation hygiene is valuable for maintainability, this finding has no DRL-specific implications and the severity is appropriate at P4.

## Cross-Review (Code Review Specialist)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Verdict** | `OBJECT` |
| **Reviewer** | Code Review Specialist |

**Evaluation:** Upon verification, the docstring Args section for `compute_contribution_reward()` (lines 466-488) matches the function signature order (lines 428-447) exactly. All 18 parameters are documented in the same order they appear in the signature. This ticket appears to be a false positive and should be closed without action.
