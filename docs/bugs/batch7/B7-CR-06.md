## Summary

**One-line summary:** Broad exception handler catches all errors during debug telemetry, hiding real issues.

**Category:**
- [ ] Correctness bug
- [ ] Race condition / concurrency
- [ ] Memory leak / resource issue
- [ ] Performance bottleneck
- [ ] Numerical stability
- [ ] torch.compile compatibility
- [ ] Dead code / unwired functionality
- [x] API design / contract violation
- [ ] Test coverage gap
- [ ] Documentation / naming
- [x] Defensive programming violation
- [ ] Legacy code policy violation

## Detailed Description

### What's Wrong

```python
try:
    layer_stats = collect_per_layer_gradients(model)
except Exception as e:  # Bare Exception
    _logger.warning("Failed to collect per-layer gradients: %s", e)
    layer_stats = None
```

Issues:
1. **Bare `Exception`** catches everything, including `KeyboardInterrupt`, `SystemExit`
2. **No traceback logged** - only the exception message, losing stack trace
3. **Silently continues** with `layer_stats = None`

In debug mode, we specifically WANT to see errors to diagnose issues. Swallowing them defeats the purpose.

---

## Recommended Fix

1. Narrow exception type:
```python
try:
    layer_stats = collect_per_layer_gradients(model)
except (RuntimeError, ValueError) as e:
    _logger.warning("Failed to collect gradients: %s", e, exc_info=True)
    layer_stats = None
```

2. Or re-raise in debug mode:
```python
try:
    layer_stats = collect_per_layer_gradients(model)
except Exception as e:
    _logger.warning("Failed to collect gradients: %s", e, exc_info=True)
    if self.config.level >= TelemetryLevel.DEBUG:
        raise  # Let debug mode see the full error
    layer_stats = None
```

## Verification

### How to Verify the Fix

- [ ] Narrow exception type OR add exc_info=True
- [ ] Test with intentionally broken model to verify logging works
- [ ] Verify traceback is visible in logs

## Cross-Review (DRL Specialist)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Verdict** | `ENDORSE` |
| **Reviewer** | DRL Specialist |

**Evaluation:** Debug telemetry exists to diagnose training issues; silently swallowing errors defeats its purpose for identifying gradient pathologies.

## Cross-Review (PyTorch Specialist)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Verdict** | `ENDORSE` |
| **Reviewer** | PyTorch Specialist |

**Evaluation:** Bare `Exception` catches `KeyboardInterrupt`/`SystemExit` - use `(RuntimeError, ValueError, AttributeError)` for model access errors specifically.

## Cross-Review (Code Review Specialist)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Verdict** | `ENDORSE` |
| **Reviewer** | Code Review Specialist |

**Evaluation:** Violates project's "defensive programming" prohibition; errors should surface, not be masked. Add `exc_info=True` at minimum.
