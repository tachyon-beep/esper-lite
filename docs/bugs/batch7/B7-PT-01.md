## Detailed Description

### What's Wrong

The code computes gradient norm manually:

```python
total_sq = sum(
    (g.float() * g.float()).sum() for g in grads
)
return float(total_sq.sqrt().item())
```

Problem: `g.float() * g.float()` can overflow to `inf` for large gradient values:
- If any gradient element > ~1.84e19 (sqrt of float32 max), squaring overflows
- More practically, gradients in the thousands can cause intermediate overflow
- `sqrt(inf)` returns `inf`, corrupting the telemetry metric

This is a known numerical stability issue that `torch.norm()` and `torch._foreach_norm()` handle internally.

---

## Recommended Fix

Use `torch._foreach_norm` which is already used elsewhere in this codebase:

```python
def compute_grad_norm_surrogate(module: nn.Module) -> float | None:
    grads = [p.grad for p in module.parameters() if p.grad is not None]
    if not grads:
        return None
    # Use vectorized norm computation (handles numerical stability internally)
    norms = torch._foreach_norm(grads, ord=2)
    total_sq = torch.stack(norms).pow(2).sum()
    return float(total_sq.sqrt().item())
```

Alternatively, use `torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_` approach:
```python
total_norm = torch.norm(torch.stack([torch.norm(g, 2) for g in grads]), 2)
return float(total_norm.item())
```

## Verification

### How to Verify the Fix

- [ ] Replace manual computation with torch._foreach_norm
- [ ] Add test with artificially large gradients (1e10 scale)
- [ ] Verify no inf/nan in output

## Related Findings

- B7-PT-04: gradient_collector.py already uses torch._foreach_norm correctly

## Cross-Review (DRL Specialist)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Verdict** | `ENDORSE` |
| **Reviewer** | DRL Specialist |

**Evaluation:** Valid numerical stability concern. Gradient norm is key for: (1) explosion detection during PPO instability, (2) clipping calibration (thresholds 0.5-1.0), (3) adaptive LR schemes. inf values corrupt these. Practical risk is lower (gradients > 1e19 rare) but fix is trivial and torch._foreach_norm is already used elsewhere.

## Cross-Review (PyTorch Specialist)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Verdict** | `REFINE` |
| **Reviewer** | PyTorch Specialist |

**Evaluation:** Legitimate concern but severity needs refinement. Float32 overflow requires |g| > 1.84e19 which is rare in practice. However, the manual loop with Python generator and .item() would cause torch.compile graph breaks - using torch._foreach_norm (single fused op) is compile-friendly. Consider P2 rather than P1.

## Cross-Review (Code Review Specialist)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Verdict** | `ENDORSE` |
| **Reviewer** | Code Review Specialist |

**Evaluation:** Valid numerical stability bug. Codebase already uses torch._foreach_norm extensively (8 occurrences in gradient_collector.py). This is reinventing the wheel poorly. Telemetry corruption is insidious - inf gradient norms logged silently makes debugging impossible. Fix is trivial and eliminates risk.
