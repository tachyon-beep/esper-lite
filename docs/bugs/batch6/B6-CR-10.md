## Summary

**One-line summary:** Three consecutive empty section headers with no content between them.

**Category:**
- [ ] Correctness bug
- [ ] Race condition / concurrency
- [ ] Memory leak / resource issue
- [ ] Performance bottleneck
- [ ] Numerical stability
- [ ] torch.compile compatibility
- [ ] Dead code / unwired functionality
- [ ] API design / contract violation
- [ ] Test coverage gap
- [x] Documentation / naming
- [ ] Defensive programming violation
- [ ] Legacy code policy violation

## Detailed Description

### What's Wrong

```python
# =============================================================================
# Reward Configuration
# =============================================================================


# =============================================================================
# Loss-Primary Reward Configuration (Phase 2)
# =============================================================================


# =============================================================================
# Contribution-Primary Reward Configuration (uses counterfactual validation)
# =============================================================================
```

Three section headers with no content between them before `ContributionRewardConfig`. This is visual noise.

---

## Recommended Fix

Consolidate or remove empty headers:

```python
# =============================================================================
# Reward Configuration Classes
# =============================================================================

@dataclass
class ContributionRewardConfig:
    # ...
```

## Verification

### How to Verify the Fix

- [ ] No functional change

## Cross-Review (PyTorch Specialist)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Verdict** | `ENDORSE` |
| **Reviewer** | PyTorch Specialist |
| **Date** | 2024-12-27 |

**Evaluation:** No PyTorch implications whatsoever. This is purely a code formatting/documentation cleanup issue. Empty section headers are visual noise but have zero impact on runtime behavior, performance, or torch.compile compatibility. P4 severity is appropriate - fix opportunistically during other work in this file.

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Verdict** | `ENDORSE` |
| **Reviewer** | Code Review Specialist |

**Evaluation:** Three consecutive empty section headers is visual noise that hinders code readability. While purely cosmetic with no functional impact, clean code organization aids maintainability. The fix is trivial (delete or consolidate) with zero risk. P4 severity is appropriate - address opportunistically during related refactoring rather than as standalone work.

## Cross-Review (DRL Specialist)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Verdict** | `NEUTRAL` |
| **Reviewer** | DRL Specialist |

**Evaluation:** Empty section headers have no impact on reward computation, policy gradients, or training dynamics. This is purely a code style issue. While cleaning up visual noise is reasonable for maintainability, it has no bearing on RL correctness. The section headers may have been placeholders for planned reward configuration classes that were consolidated - removing them is fine but not urgent from a training perspective.
