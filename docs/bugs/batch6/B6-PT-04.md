## Summary

**One-line summary:** `base_acc_delta` field is never set by any reward function; vestigial from older design.

**Category:**
- [ ] Correctness bug
- [ ] Race condition / concurrency
- [ ] Memory leak / resource issue
- [ ] Performance bottleneck
- [ ] Numerical stability
- [ ] torch.compile compatibility
- [x] Dead code / unwired functionality
- [ ] API design / contract violation
- [ ] Test coverage gap
- [ ] Documentation / naming
- [ ] Defensive programming violation
- [x] Legacy code policy violation

## Detailed Description

### What's Wrong

```python
@dataclass(slots=True)
class RewardComponentsTelemetry:
    base_acc_delta: float = 0.0  # Comment says "legacy shaped reward"
```

The `base_acc_delta` field:
1. Has a comment suggesting it's legacy
2. Is never set by any reward function
3. Is always 0.0
4. Appears in `to_dict()` output, polluting telemetry

Per project policy: "When something is removed or changed, DELETE THE OLD CODE COMPLETELY."

---

## Recommended Fix

Remove the field entirely:

```python
@dataclass(slots=True)
class RewardComponentsTelemetry:
    # Remove: base_acc_delta: float = 0.0
```

Also remove from `to_dict()` method.

---

## Verification

### How to Verify the Fix

- [ ] Search codebase for base_acc_delta assignments
- [ ] If none found, remove the field
- [ ] Update to_dict() method
- [ ] Run tests to verify no breakage

## Cross-Review (PyTorch Specialist)

| Field | Value |

| **Verdict** | `ENDORSE` |

| **Date** | 2024-12-27 |

**Evaluation:** Dead fields in telemetry dataclasses add noise to training logs and metrics dashboards, making it harder to diagnose actual training issues. While there is no direct PyTorch impact (this is pure Python), the project's explicit No Legacy Code Policy applies. Removing vestigial fields improves signal-to-noise ratio in telemetry, which is essential for debugging training runs. Straightforward deletion with no risk.

## Cross-Review (DRL Specialist)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Verdict** | `ENDORSE` |
| **Reviewer** | DRL Specialist |

**Evaluation:** Dead telemetry fields pollute reward diagnostics and create false signal during debugging. When investigating reward component magnitudes or credit assignment issues, engineers may waste time examining `base_acc_delta` before realizing it is vestigial. Per the No Legacy Code Policy, this should be deleted. The field name suggests it was meant to capture accuracy delta as a reward component, which is a reasonable signal; if this was intentionally removed from the reward, the telemetry field should follow.

## Cross-Review (Code Review Specialist)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Verdict** | `OBJECT` |
| **Reviewer** | Code Review Specialist |

**Evaluation:** The ticket's claim that `base_acc_delta` is "never set" is **incorrect**. Grep shows it IS set in `vectorized.py:2904` and `emitters.py:277`. The field is actively used, not vestigial. The ticket should be closed as invalid, or re-scoped to verify whether those assignment paths are actually reached during normal execution. This requires tracing the call graph before declaring it dead code.
