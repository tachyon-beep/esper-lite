## Summary

**One-line summary:** `if self.state.metrics.epochs_in_current_stage < 1` is always False because line 2401 just incremented it.

**Category:**
- [ ] Correctness bug
- [ ] Race condition / concurrency
- [ ] Memory leak / resource issue
- [ ] Performance bottleneck
- [ ] Numerical stability
- [ ] torch.compile compatibility
- [x] Dead code / unwired functionality
- [ ] API design / contract violation
- [ ] Test coverage gap
- [ ] Documentation / naming
- [ ] Defensive programming violation
- [ ] Legacy code policy violation

## Detailed Description

### What's Wrong

The condition `epochs_in_current_stage < 1` is always False because line 2401 just incremented `epochs_in_current_stage` from 0 to at least 1.

### Code Evidence

```python
# /home/john/esper-lite/src/esper/kasmina/slot.py:2399-2405

if stage == SeedStage.RESETTING:
    self.state.metrics.epochs_total += 1
    self.state.metrics.epochs_in_current_stage += 1  # Now >= 1

    # Resetting is a short cleanup dwell; keep it 1 tick for now.
    if self.state.metrics.epochs_in_current_stage < 1:  # ALWAYS FALSE!
        return False
```

---

## Recommended Fix

Remove the dead code:

```python
if stage == SeedStage.RESETTING:
    self.state.metrics.epochs_total += 1
    self.state.metrics.epochs_in_current_stage += 1
    # Resetting completes after 1 epoch
    return True  # Always advance
```

## Verification

### How to Verify the Fix

- [ ] Remove dead branch
- [ ] Add test for RESETTING stage transition

## Cross-Review

|-------|-------|
| **Verdict** | ENDORSE |
| **Reviewer** | cross-review-agent |
| **Date** | 2024-12-27 |

**Evaluation:** Verified - line 2401 increments `epochs_in_current_stage` before line 2404 checks `< 1`, making the branch unreachable dead code.
The suggested fix is correct; remove the dead branch and simplify the RESETTING stage handling.

## Cross-Review (PyTorch Specialist)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Verdict** | ENDORSE |
| **Reviewer** | pytorch-specialist |
| **Date** | 2024-12-27 |

**Evaluation:** Dead branch is pure Python control flow outside any tensor operations - no torch.compile, CUDA, or memory concerns.
Removal is safe; no kasmina code is currently compiled, so no graph break implications from this refactor.

## Cross-Review (DRL Specialist)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Verdict** | `ENDORSE` |
| **Reviewer** | DRL Specialist |
| **Date** | 2024-12-27 |

**Evaluation:** Verified dead branch - the condition can never be True since the increment precedes it. No RL training impact (RESETTING is a cleanup stage, not a learning stage), but dead code obscures the intended 1-epoch dwell logic and should be removed per project policy.
