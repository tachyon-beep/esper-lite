## Detailed Description

### What's Wrong

`InteractionTerm` dataclass is defined in `counterfactual.py` but not exported. Users calling `get_interaction_terms()` receive `InteractionTerm` objects without access to the type for type hints:

```python
__all__ = [
    "CounterfactualEngine",
    "CounterfactualConfig",
    "CounterfactualMatrix",
    "ShapleyEstimate",
    # Missing: "InteractionTerm", "CounterfactualResult"
    ...
]
```

---

## Recommended Fix

Add `InteractionTerm` and `CounterfactualResult` to exports if they're part of the public API:

```python
__all__ = [
    "CounterfactualEngine",
    "CounterfactualConfig",
    "CounterfactualMatrix",
    "ShapleyEstimate",
    "InteractionTerm",      # Add
    "CounterfactualResult", # Add (if public)
    ...
]
```

---

## Verification

### How to Verify the Fix

- [ ] Determine which types are public API
- [ ] Add to __all__ as appropriate
- [ ] Verify imports work correctly

**Evaluation:** Valid API hygiene issue. `InteractionTerm` is returned by `compute_interaction_terms()` and `CounterfactualResult` is used in `CounterfactualMatrix.configs`, making both part of the public API contract. Users cannot type-hint results from these methods without access to the types, which is a genuine usability problem for downstream code doing Shapley-based attribution analysis.

**Evaluation:** Valid finding. `InteractionTerm` is a dataclass returned by `get_interaction_terms()` and users need the type for proper type hints in their consuming code. The fix is trivial (add to `__all__`) and has zero runtime impact. Confirmed that `InteractionTerm` is defined at line 163 in counterfactual.py but not re-exported through the module's public API.

## Cross-Review (Code Review Specialist)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Verdict** | `ENDORSE` |
| **Reviewer** | Code Review Specialist |

**Evaluation:** Confirmed. `InteractionTerm` is returned by `CounterfactualEngine.compute_interactions()` (line 464) and `CounterfactualResult` is used in `CounterfactualMatrix.configs` (line 85), both without being exported in `__all__`. This forces users to import directly from `counterfactual.py` rather than the package, breaking the public API contract. Simple fix with no risk.
