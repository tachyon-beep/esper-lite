## Summary

**One-line summary:** Step assignment at L177 is immediately overwritten by conditional at L179, creating redundant code.

**Category:**
- [ ] Correctness bug
- [ ] Race condition / concurrency
- [ ] Memory leak / resource issue
- [ ] Performance bottleneck
- [ ] Numerical stability
- [ ] torch.compile compatibility
- [ ] Dead code / unwired functionality
- [ ] API design / contract violation
- [ ] Test coverage gap
- [x] Documentation / naming
- [ ] Defensive programming violation
- [ ] Legacy code policy violation

## Detailed Description

### What's Wrong

The pattern `step = X` followed immediately by `step if step is not None else self._current_step` is redundant - the first assignment is never used if step was passed as an argument.

### Code Evidence

```python
# /home/john/esper-lite/src/esper/kasmina/blending.py:177-179

step = step  # Assigned from parameter
current = step if step is not None else self._current_step  # Immediately re-evaluated
```

### Impact

Minor style issue - no performance or correctness impact.

---

## Recommended Fix

Simplify to:

```python
current = step if step is not None else self._current_step
```

## Cross-Review

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Reviewer** | `drl` |
| **Verdict** | `OBJECT` |

**Evaluation:** The ticket misreads the code: L177 updates internal state `_current_step` as a side-effect, L179 resolves fallback -- not redundant.
This is correct stateful alpha scheduling for blending; the pattern intentionally separates mutation from resolution.
