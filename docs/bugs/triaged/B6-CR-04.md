## Detailed Description

### What's Wrong

```python
exp_arg = min(-config.attribution_sigmoid_steepness * total_imp, 700.0)
attribution_discount = 1.0 / (1.0 + math.exp(exp_arg))
```

The value `700.0` is the float64 exp() overflow protection threshold (`math.exp(709.78)` overflows), but it appears without explanation at point of use. A reader must know float64 limits to understand why this value was chosen.

---

## Recommended Fix

Extract to a named constant with documentation:

```python
# Near top of file, with other constants
_EXP_OVERFLOW_GUARD = 700.0  # math.exp(709.78) overflows float64; 700 is conservative

# At use site
exp_arg = min(-config.attribution_sigmoid_steepness * total_imp, _EXP_OVERFLOW_GUARD)
```

Or add inline comment:

```python
# Guard: math.exp(709.78) overflows float64; 700 is conservative
exp_arg = min(-config.attribution_sigmoid_steepness * total_imp, 700.0)
```

**Evaluation:** Valid numerical stability finding. The 700.0 threshold is correctly chosen (math.exp(709.78) overflows float64), but this is critical domain knowledge that should be explicit. From a PyTorch perspective, this pattern becomes even more important when rewards eventually flow into tensor operations - silent overflow protection that is undocumented can lead to debugging nightmares. Recommend extracting to a named constant in leyline (e.g., `FLOAT64_EXP_SAFE_MAX = 700.0`) since this is a numerical precision constant that could be reused elsewhere. The current inline value is correct but fragile to maintenance.

**Evaluation:** This is more than a documentation issue from an RL perspective. The 700.0 clamp affects the attribution_discount sigmoid, which controls how improvement gets credited to seeds. When `attribution_sigmoid_steepness * total_imp` approaches 700, the discount saturates at approximately 0 (since exp(700) dominates the denominator), effectively zeroing out the bounded_attribution component. This is intentional anti-gaming behavior but needs documentation because future tuning of `attribution_sigmoid_steepness` could unknowingly trigger this clamp. A named constant like `_EXP_OVERFLOW_GUARD` prevents accidental removal during refactoring and signals the credit assignment implications.

**Evaluation:** The finding correctly identifies a magic number without explanation at line 536. The existing inline comment at line 535 ("Clamp exponent to prevent overflow: exp(709) is the float64 limit") partially documents the intent but 700.0 itself is unexplained. The recommended fix to extract `_EXP_OVERFLOW_GUARD = 700.0` with a comment explaining the conservative margin is good practice for numerical stability code. This follows the leyline pattern of extracting magic numbers to named constants.
