## Summary

**One-line summary:** Function handles too many responsibilities: model creation, training, validation, reward, action, and telemetry.

**Category:**
- [ ] Correctness bug
- [ ] Race condition / concurrency
- [ ] Memory leak / resource issue
- [ ] Performance bottleneck
- [ ] Numerical stability
- [ ] torch.compile compatibility
- [ ] Dead code / unwired functionality
- [x] API design / contract violation
- [ ] Test coverage gap
- [ ] Documentation / naming
- [ ] Defensive programming violation
- [ ] Legacy code policy violation

## Detailed Description

### What's Wrong

`run_heuristic_episode()` is a 340+ line function that:
1. Creates model
2. Runs training loop
3. Runs validation
4. Computes rewards
5. Executes heuristic actions
6. Collects telemetry

This violates single responsibility principle and makes the function hard to:
- Test individual components
- Understand at a glance
- Modify without side effects

### Impact

- **Testing difficulty**: Can't test epoch processing independently
- **Maintenance burden**: Changes require understanding entire function
- **Code duplication**: Much logic duplicates train_ppo_vectorized

---

## Recommended Fix

Extract logical units:

```python
def run_heuristic_episode(...) -> ...:
    """Orchestrates heuristic training - delegates to helpers."""
    model, optimizer = _setup_heuristic_model(config, device)

    for epoch in range(max_epochs):
        train_metrics = _run_heuristic_train_epoch(model, optimizer, ...)
        val_metrics = _run_heuristic_val_epoch(model, ...)
        reward = _compute_heuristic_reward(train_metrics, val_metrics, ...)
        action = heuristic_policy.select(...)
        _execute_heuristic_action(action, model, ...)

    return history
```

---

## Verification

### How to Verify the Fix

- [ ] Extract epoch processing to separate function
- [ ] Extract action execution to separate function
- [ ] Add unit tests for extracted functions
- [ ] Verify no behavioral changes
