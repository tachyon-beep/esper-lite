## Summary

**One-line summary:** Comment explaining type check is redundant - isinstance already makes this clear.

**Category:**
- [ ] Correctness bug
- [ ] Race condition / concurrency
- [ ] Memory leak / resource issue
- [ ] Performance bottleneck
- [ ] Numerical stability
- [ ] torch.compile compatibility
- [ ] Dead code / unwired functionality
- [ ] API design / contract violation
- [ ] Test coverage gap
- [x] Documentation / naming
- [ ] Defensive programming violation
- [ ] Legacy code policy violation

## Detailed Description

### What's Wrong

```python
# Lines 227-233
# head[-1] is a Linear layer, access .weight.data to get Tensor
last_layer = head[-1]
if isinstance(last_layer, nn.Linear):
    nn.init.orthogonal_(last_layer.weight.data, gain=0.01)
```

The comment explains that `head[-1]` is a Linear layer and we need to check with isinstance. However, the isinstance check itself is self-documenting - the comment adds no additional information.

### Impact

- **Code noise**: Comment states the obvious
- **Maintenance**: Comment could become stale if code changes

---

## Recommended Fix

Remove the redundant comment:

```python
last_layer = head[-1]
if isinstance(last_layer, nn.Linear):
    nn.init.orthogonal_(last_layer.weight.data, gain=0.01)
```

Or if keeping a comment, make it explain *why* rather than *what*:

```python
# Small gain for stable initial policy (prevents overconfident actions)
last_layer = head[-1]
if isinstance(last_layer, nn.Linear):
    nn.init.orthogonal_(last_layer.weight.data, gain=0.01)
```

## Verification

### How to Verify the Fix

- [ ] Remove or improve comment
- [ ] Verify no test failures (comment-only change)
