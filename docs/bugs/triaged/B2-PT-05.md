## Detailed Description

### What's Wrong

For `channels=3` (RGB input), `max(1, 3 // 4) = max(1, 0) = 1`. This creates a 1-dimensional bottleneck in the gate network, which may not have sufficient capacity to learn meaningful per-sample gating.

### Code Evidence

```python
# /home/john/esper-lite/src/esper/kasmina/blending.py:143

hidden_dim = max(1, channels // 4)  # For channels=3: hidden_dim=1
self.gate = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(channels, hidden_dim),  # 3 -> 1
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Linear(hidden_dim, 1),  # 1 -> 1
)
```

### Why This Matters

A 1-dimensional hidden layer has very limited representational capacity:
- Can only learn a single threshold-based gating function
- May not capture nuanced sample-level features
- Could degrade to effectively uniform gating

---

## Recommended Fix

Set a minimum hidden dimension (e.g., 8) to ensure reasonable capacity:

```python
hidden_dim = max(8, channels // 4)
```

Or use a different formula:

```python
hidden_dim = max(4, min(64, channels // 2))
```

---

## Verification

### How to Verify the Fix

- [ ] Add test for small-channel edge case (channels=1, 2, 3)
- [ ] Verify gate network can learn non-trivial gating patterns with small inputs
- [ ] Benchmark gate expressiveness across channel sizes

## Cross-Review (DRL Specialist)

**Verdict:** ENDORSE

Critical RL concern: a 1-dim gate bottleneck severely limits credit assignment granularity. Per-sample gating is fundamental to RL's ability to distinguish which samples benefited from seed blending. Minimum hidden_dim=8 preserves expressivity without adding significant compute.

---

## Cross-Review (PyTorch Specialist)

**Verdict:** ENDORSE

Valid concern. For channels=3 (RGB), `max(1, 3//4)=1` creates a 3->1->1 bottleneck with essentially no representational capacity. Minimum hidden_dim of 8 or `max(4, channels)` would ensure non-degenerate gating. Recommend fix before using GatedBlend on early-layer RGB inputs.

## Cross-Review (Code Review Specialist)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Verdict** | `ENDORSE` |
| **Reviewer** | Code Review Specialist |

**Evaluation:** Valid concern confirmed. Line 150 shows `hidden_dim = max(1, channels // 4)` which produces hidden_dim=1 for channels <= 4. A 1-dim bottleneck severely limits gate expressiveness. Recommend `max(8, channels // 4)` as minimum viable capacity for meaningful per-sample gating, though note this is P3 severity since RGB inputs (channels=3) are uncommon in mid-network slots where GatedBlend is typically applied.
