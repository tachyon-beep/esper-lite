## Summary

**One-line summary:** Protocol methods use `...` (ellipsis) for body; some linters prefer `pass` for consistency.

**Category:**
- [ ] Correctness bug
- [ ] Race condition / concurrency
- [ ] Memory leak / resource issue
- [ ] Performance bottleneck
- [ ] Numerical stability
- [ ] torch.compile compatibility
- [ ] Dead code / unwired functionality
- [ ] API design / contract violation
- [ ] Test coverage gap
- [x] Documentation / naming
- [ ] Defensive programming violation
- [ ] Legacy code policy violation

## Detailed Description

### What's Wrong

Protocol method bodies use `...` (ellipsis). While this is correct Python for Protocols, some linters may flag it and prefer `pass` for consistency with abstract methods.

### Why This Is Actually Fine

Using `...` in Protocol methods is idiomatic and explicitly recommended by typing.Protocol documentation. No action needed unless linter configuration requires it.

---

## Resolution

**Wont-fix** - `...` is the correct idiom for Protocol methods.

## Cross-Review

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Reviewer** | `drl` |
| **Verdict** | `ENDORSE` |

**Evaluation:** Ellipsis (`...`) is the canonical idiom for Protocol method stubs per PEP 544 and typing documentation.
Ticket correctly identifies this as wont-fix; closing with endorsement of current style.
