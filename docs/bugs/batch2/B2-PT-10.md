## Summary

**One-line summary:** Return types are `torch.Tensor` but mypy type ignores are scattered throughout blend_ops.py.

**Category:**
- [ ] Correctness bug
- [ ] Race condition / concurrency
- [ ] Memory leak / resource issue
- [ ] Performance bottleneck
- [ ] Numerical stability
- [ ] torch.compile compatibility
- [ ] Dead code / unwired functionality
- [ ] API design / contract violation
- [ ] Test coverage gap
- [x] Documentation / naming
- [ ] Defensive programming violation
- [ ] Legacy code policy violation

## Detailed Description

### What's Wrong

The blend operators have explicit `-> torch.Tensor` return type annotations but use `# type: ignore` comments in various places. Consider enabling strict return type enforcement or fixing the type issues.

### Why This Is Low Priority

The type ignores may be necessary due to PyTorch tensor operation type inference limitations. Forcing strict types could create noise without improving safety.

---

## Recommended Fix

Audit each type ignore and either:
1. Fix the underlying type issue
2. Document why the ignore is necessary

## Cross-Review

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Reviewer** | `drl` |
| **Verdict** | `NEUTRAL` |

**Evaluation:** Type ignores on `torch.lerp` / tensor ops are PyTorch stub limitations, not code defects -- fixing requires upstream stubs.
Low value cleanup; blend_ops correctness is enforced by unit tests, not mypy; leave as-is unless stubs improve.
