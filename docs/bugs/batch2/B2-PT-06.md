## Summary

**One-line summary:** Manual `x.mean(dim=[2, 3])` could use `F.adaptive_avg_pool2d(x, 1).flatten(1)` for cleaner code.

**Category:**
- [ ] Correctness bug
- [ ] Race condition / concurrency
- [ ] Memory leak / resource issue
- [ ] Performance bottleneck
- [ ] Numerical stability
- [ ] torch.compile compatibility
- [ ] Dead code / unwired functionality
- [ ] API design / contract violation
- [ ] Test coverage gap
- [x] Documentation / naming
- [ ] Defensive programming violation
- [ ] Legacy code policy violation

## Detailed Description

### What's Wrong

The current implementation uses `x.mean(dim=[2, 3])` for CNN pooling. While correct, `F.adaptive_avg_pool2d(x, 1).flatten(1)` is more idiomatic for global average pooling and may be slightly more efficient as it avoids intermediate dimension tracking.

### Code Evidence

```python
# /home/john/esper-lite/src/esper/kasmina/blending.py:159-165

def _pool_features(self, x: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    if self.topology == "cnn":
        return x.mean(dim=[2, 3])  # Global average pool
    else:
        return x.mean(dim=1)  # Sequence average for transformer
```

### Impact

Performance difference is negligible. This is primarily a code clarity improvement.

---

## Recommended Fix

```python
def _pool_features(self, x: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    if self.topology == "cnn":
        return F.adaptive_avg_pool2d(x, 1).flatten(1)
    else:
        return x.mean(dim=1)
```

## Verification

### How to Verify the Fix

- [ ] Verify output shapes match for both implementations
- [ ] Benchmark to confirm no performance regression

---

## Related Findings

None.

## Cross-Review (DRL Specialist)

**Verdict:** OBJECT

The current `x.mean(dim=[2,3])` is idiomatic, correct, and equally efficient under torch.compile. `adaptive_avg_pool2d` adds an extra flatten operation and obscures intent. This is a stylistic non-issue that does not affect RL training dynamics or gradient flow.

---

## Cross-Review (PyTorch Specialist)

**Verdict:** NEUTRAL

Both `x.mean(dim=[2,3])` and `F.adaptive_avg_pool2d(x,1).flatten(1)` compile to identical operations under TorchInductor. The current code is more explicit about the reduction semantics. Pure style preference with no performance or correctness impact; not worth a change.

---

## Cross-Review (Code Review Specialist)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Verdict** | `NEUTRAL` |
| **Reviewer** | Code Review Specialist |

**Evaluation:** Marginal stylistic preference with no practical benefit. `x.mean(dim=[2, 3])` is semantically clear, widely understood, and performs identically to `adaptive_avg_pool2d(x, 1).flatten(1)` under `torch.compile`. The adaptive pooling variant adds an extra `flatten()` call. No actionable improvement; correctly categorized as documentation/naming P3 but could be closed as "won't fix" without impact.
