## Summary

**One-line summary:** `_alpha_cache_local` is thread-local but `reset_cache()` only clears the calling thread's cache - other DataParallel workers accumulate entries.

**Category:**
- [ ] Correctness bug
- [ ] Race condition / concurrency
- [x] Memory leak / resource issue
- [ ] Performance bottleneck
- [ ] Numerical stability
- [ ] torch.compile compatibility
- [ ] Dead code / unwired functionality
- [ ] API design / contract violation
- [ ] Test coverage gap
- [ ] Documentation / naming
- [ ] Defensive programming violation
- [ ] Legacy code policy violation

## Detailed Description

### What's Wrong

The thread-local pattern for alpha caching is correct for DataParallel safety, but the cleanup mechanism only clears the current thread's cache. In long-running DataParallel training with persistent workers, other threads accumulate cache entries that never get cleared.

### Code Evidence

```python
# /home/john/esper-lite/src/esper/kasmina/blending.py:62-63, 93-104

def __init__(self) -> None:
    self._alpha_cache_local = threading.local()  # Per-thread cache

def reset_cache(self) -> None:
    """Clear thread-local alpha tensor cache."""
    self._alpha_cache_local.cache = None  # Only clears calling thread!
```

### Impact

- Memory accumulation across epochs
- Each DataParallel worker holds onto cached tensors
- Impact is small per-worker but scales with worker count

---

## Recommended Fix

### Option A: Document reset_cache() requirements

Clearly document that `reset_cache()` must be called from each worker thread:

```python
def reset_cache(self) -> None:
    """Clear this thread's alpha tensor cache.

    IMPORTANT: In DataParallel, this only clears the calling thread's cache.
    To clear all worker caches, call this from within each worker's context
    (e.g., via a custom collate_fn hook at epoch boundaries).
    """
```

### Option B: Track all thread-local instances

More complex but comprehensive:

```python
_all_thread_locals: weakref.WeakSet[threading.local] = weakref.WeakSet()

def __init__(self) -> None:
    self._alpha_cache_local = threading.local()
    BlendAlgorithm._all_thread_locals.add(self._alpha_cache_local)

@classmethod
def reset_all_caches(cls) -> None:
    """Clear caches across all threads (requires GC cooperation)."""
    for local in cls._all_thread_locals:
        if hasattr(local, 'cache'):
            del local.cache
```

## Verification

### How to Verify the Fix

- [ ] Profile memory usage in DataParallel training across epochs
- [ ] Verify cache clearing works in worker threads

## Cross-Review

| Agent | Verdict | Evaluation |
|-------|---------|------------|
| **PyTorch** | ENDORSE | Thread-local caching is incompatible with torch.compile (Dynamo cannot trace across thread boundaries) and DataParallel is deprecated in favor of DDP. Memory leak is real but symptom of deeper architectural issue - recommend migrating to DDP with process-isolated caching. |
| **CodeReview** | ENDORSE | Valid memory leak concern - thread-local cleanup is a known pitfall with DataParallel. Option A (documentation) is the pragmatic fix; Option B adds complexity for marginal benefit in typical training runs. |
| **DRL** | ENDORSE | Alpha tensor caching directly affects blending weight computation during policy forward passes. Stale/accumulating caches across DataParallel workers cause inconsistent alpha values per worker, which corrupts the blended policy output and introduces non-reproducible variance into the advantage estimates. |

---

## Resolution

**Fix:** Implemented Option A — enhanced `reset_cache()` docstring with explicit warning about thread-local semantics.

**Changes:**
- `src/esper/kasmina/blending.py:93-107`: Updated docstring to warn that in DataParallel, `reset_cache()` only clears the calling thread's cache
