## Summary

**One-line summary:** `AlphaController` is used in slot.py but not exported from `kasmina/__init__.py` - users must import from `.alpha_controller` directly.

**Category:**
- [ ] Correctness bug
- [ ] Race condition / concurrency
- [ ] Memory leak / resource issue
- [ ] Performance bottleneck
- [ ] Numerical stability
- [ ] torch.compile compatibility
- [ ] Dead code / unwired functionality
- [x] API design / contract violation
- [ ] Test coverage gap
- [ ] Documentation / naming
- [ ] Defensive programming violation
- [ ] Legacy code policy violation

## Detailed Description

### What's Wrong

`AlphaController` is an important class used by `SeedSlot`, but it's not re-exported in `kasmina/__init__.py`. Users who want to directly work with alpha controllers must import from the submodule.

### Impact

Minor inconvenience - not a bug.

---

## Recommended Fix

Add to `__init__.py`:

```python
from esper.kasmina.alpha_controller import AlphaController

__all__ = [
    # ...existing exports...
    "AlphaController",
]
```

## Cross-Review

| Agent | Verdict | Evaluation |
|-------|---------|------------|
| **DRL** | ENDORSE | AlphaController governs blending coefficients that determine how much seed output influences the host - this is the core mechanism for progressive policy integration during training. Exposing it in the public API enables hyperparameter tuning of the blending schedule, which directly affects training stability. |
| **PyTorch** | NEUTRAL | Package-level re-exports have no impact on PyTorch internals, torch.compile, or model behavior. Whether AlphaController is imported via `kasmina` or `kasmina.alpha_controller` is purely an API ergonomics decision with no performance or compilation implications. |
| **CodeReview** | ENDORSE | Public API completeness matters for discoverability and IDE autocomplete; if `AlphaController` is part of the domain's contract (used by `SeedSlot`), it should be exported. The fix is trivial and improves developer experience with no downside. |

---

## Resolution

**Status:** Fixed

**Fix:** Added `AlphaController` to `kasmina/__init__.py` exports.

**Changes:**
- `src/esper/kasmina/__init__.py`: Added import and `__all__` entry for `AlphaController`

**Verification:**
- `from esper.kasmina import AlphaController` works

**Sign-off:** Approved by `feature-dev:code-reviewer` (via cross-review ENDORSE verdict)
