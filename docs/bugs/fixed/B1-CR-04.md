## Summary

**One-line summary:** `GovernorReport.consecutive_panics` shows 0 after rollback because it's reset before being included in the report.

**Category:**
- [ ] Correctness bug
- [ ] Race condition / concurrency
- [ ] Memory leak / resource issue
- [ ] Performance bottleneck
- [ ] Numerical stability
- [ ] torch.compile compatibility
- [ ] Dead code / unwired functionality
- [ ] API design / contract violation
- [ ] Test coverage gap
- [x] Documentation / naming
- [ ] Defensive programming violation
- [ ] Legacy code policy violation

## Detailed Description

### What's Wrong

The field name `consecutive_panics` in `GovernorReport` is potentially misleading. After `execute_rollback()`:
1. Line 327: `self.consecutive_panics` is reset to 0
2. Lines 330-336: Report is created with `consecutive_panics=self.consecutive_panics` (now 0)

The report reflects the **post-rollback** state, not the **pre-rollback** count.

### Code Evidence

```python
# /home/john/esper-lite/src/esper/tolaria/governor.py:327

self.consecutive_panics = 0  # Reset counter

# Later at lines 330-336:
return GovernorReport(
    ...
    consecutive_panics=self.consecutive_panics,  # This is now 0
    rollback_occurred=True,
)
```

### Why This Matters

- Developers may expect `consecutive_panics` to show how many panics led to the rollback
- The name doesn't indicate it's the post-rollback value
- Could cause confusion when debugging governor behavior

### Verification This is Intentional

Test confirms this behavior is expected:
```python
# tests/tolaria/test_governor.py:319-320
assert report.consecutive_panics == 0  # Reset after rollback
```

---

## System Context

This is a documentation/naming clarity issue, not a bug. The behavior is intentional and tested.

---

## Recommended Fix

### Approach

One of:
1. Rename field to `consecutive_panics_after_rollback` (breaking change)
2. Add docstring to GovernorReport explaining the semantics
3. Keep pre-rollback count separately if needed for debugging

### Suggested Code Change (Option 2 - Minimal)

```python
# /home/john/esper-lite/src/esper/tolaria/governor.py (GovernorReport dataclass)

@dataclass
class GovernorReport:
    """Report from governor health check.

    Note: consecutive_panics reflects the post-rollback state (0 after rollback).
    The pre-rollback count is available in the GOVERNOR_ROLLBACK telemetry event.
    """
    ...
```

---

## Verification

### How to Verify the Fix

- [ ] Documentation: Verify docstring is added and clear
- [ ] No behavior change needed - existing tests pass

### Test Files to Update

- None needed - behavior is intentional

---

## Cross-Review

| Agent | Verdict | Evaluation |
|-------|---------|------------|
| **DRL** | NEUTRAL | Post-rollback panic count of 0 is semantically correct (the counter resets after recovery action). Pre-rollback count is preserved in telemetry events which is the right place for debugging training instability. |
| **PyTorch** | NEUTRAL | Field naming clarity is purely semantic/documentation; the actual rollback mechanics (checkpoint restore, optimizer state reset) are unaffected. No torch.compile guards, tensor layout, or memory implications - handle as documentation task if desired. |
| **CodeReview** | NEUTRAL | The behavior is intentional and tested, but the concern is overstated. A docstring clarification is acceptable but low value. The telemetry event at line 261 already captures `consecutive_panics` before reset, so the pre-rollback count is available where it matters most. |
