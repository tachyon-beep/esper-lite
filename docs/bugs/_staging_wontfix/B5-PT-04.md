## Detailed Description

### What's Wrong

```python
# BUG-027: Antithetic sampling...
```

The comment references "BUG-027" but:
1. No link to issue tracker
2. No explanation of what the bug was
3. Future maintainers can't look up context

---

## Recommended Fix

Either:

1. **Add canonical reference:**
```python
# BUG-027 (https://github.com/.../issues/27): Antithetic sampling...
```

2. **Expand the explanation:**
```python
# Antithetic sampling: Use both permutation and its reverse to reduce variance.
# This technique pairs permutations to cancel out first-order bias.
```

3. **Remove the reference if obsolete:**
```python
# Antithetic sampling for variance reduction...
```

## Cross-Review (PyTorch Specialist)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Verdict** | `NEUTRAL` |
| **Reviewer** | PyTorch Specialist |
| **Date** | 2024-12-27 |

**Evaluation:** This is purely a documentation/comment hygiene issue with no PyTorch-specific implications. The orphaned "BUG-027" reference has no impact on tensor operations, compilation, or runtime behavior. Recommend addressing during normal code maintenance rather than prioritizing as a standalone fix.

## Cross-Review (DRL Specialist)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Verdict** | `NEUTRAL` |
| **Reviewer** | DRL Specialist |

**Evaluation:** The orphaned bug reference is a minor documentation issue that does not affect RL training correctness or stability. Antithetic sampling is a legitimate variance reduction technique for Shapley value estimation (pairing permutations with their reverses to cancel first-order bias), so the underlying code is sound. Recommend option 2 (expanding the explanation) since the technique itself merits a brief description for future maintainers unfamiliar with variance reduction in Monte Carlo Shapley estimation.

## Cross-Review (Code Review Specialist)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Verdict** | `ENDORSE` |
| **Reviewer** | Code Review Specialist |

**Evaluation:** The finding is valid - the comment at L393 says "FIX BUG-027" without providing any issue tracker link or explanation of what BUG-027 was. Inspecting the code, the comment is partially self-documenting ("Avoid materializing all permutations"). Recommendation: remove the "BUG-027" reference entirely since it adds no value without context, and the code comment already explains the intent.
