## Summary

**One-line summary:** Package docstring could explain what "fail-safe" means for readers unfamiliar with the codebase.

**Category:**
- [ ] Correctness bug
- [ ] Race condition / concurrency
- [ ] Memory leak / resource issue
- [ ] Performance bottleneck
- [ ] Numerical stability
- [ ] torch.compile compatibility
- [ ] Dead code / unwired functionality
- [ ] API design / contract violation
- [ ] Test coverage gap
- [x] Documentation / naming
- [ ] Defensive programming violation
- [ ] Legacy code policy violation

## Detailed Description

### What's Wrong

The package docstring mentions Governor is a "fail-safe watchdog" but doesn't explain what failures it detects or what actions it takes.

### Code Evidence

```python
# /home/john/esper-lite/src/esper/tolaria/__init__.py:1-9

"""Tolaria - Model Training Infrastructure

This package provides:
- environment: Model factory (create_model)
- governor: Fail-safe watchdog for catastrophic failure detection
...
"""
```

### Why This Matters

- New developers must read governor.py to understand what "fail-safe" means
- Minor onboarding friction
- Documentation could be more self-contained

---

## Recommended Fix

### Suggested Code Change

```python
# /home/john/esper-lite/src/esper/tolaria/__init__.py

"""Tolaria - Model Training Infrastructure (Metabolism)

This package provides:
- environment: Model factory (create_model)
- governor: Fail-safe watchdog for catastrophic failure detection
  - Detects: NaN/Inf losses, loss explosions, "lobotomy" (uniform outputs)
  - Actions: Rollback to last known good state, RL punishment signal
  - See: The "Governor prevents catastrophe" principle in ROADMAP.md

Tolaria handles the "metabolism" of training - converting data into trained weights.
The actual training loop orchestration is in simic.training.
"""
```

## Verification

### How to Verify the Fix

- [ ] Manual: Read updated docstring and verify it's helpful to newcomers

### Test Files to Update

- None needed - documentation only

---

## Resolution

### Decision: Won't Fix

1. **Already documented** — ROADMAP.md explains Governor in detail
2. **Duplication risk** — Docstrings that repeat ROADMAP content will become stale
3. **Per CLAUDE.md** — Developers should read ROADMAP.md for architecture context

Current docstring is adequate.

## Cross-Review

| Agent | Verdict | Evaluation |
|-------|---------|------------|
| **DRL** | NEUTRAL | Documentation enhancement has no bearing on RL training correctness, gradient flow, or learning dynamics. Useful for onboarding but irrelevant to training stability, reward integrity, or PPO health metrics. |
| **PyTorch** | NEUTRAL | Docstring improvements are entirely orthogonal to PyTorch runtime behavior, compile graphs, or numerical correctness. No torch.compile, CUDA, or tensor operation concerns; strictly a documentation enhancement. |
| **CodeReview** | NEUTRAL | The docstring enhancement is reasonable but very low priority; the existing docstring is adequate and ROADMAP.md already explains Governor. New developers should read ROADMAP.md per CLAUDE.md instructions anyway - duplicating content in docstrings risks staleness. |
