## Summary

**One-line summary:** Usage of `optimizer.state.get(p)` was flagged for review but is legitimate per codebase guidelines.

**Category:**
- [ ] Correctness bug

- [ ] Memory leak / resource issue
- [ ] Performance bottleneck
- [ ] Numerical stability
- [ ] torch.compile compatibility
- [ ] Dead code / unwired functionality
- [ ] API design / contract violation
- [ ] Test coverage gap
- [ ] Documentation / naming
- [ ] Defensive programming violation
- [ ] Legacy code policy violation

## Detailed Description

### What's Wrong

Nothing - this was reviewed and found to be a **legitimate use** of `.get()`.

### Code Evidence

```python
# /home/john/esper-lite/src/esper/tolaria/governor.py:320

state = optimizer.state.get(p)
if state:
    # Zero momentum buffers
    ...
```

### Why This is Legitimate

Per codebase guidelines, `.get()` is prohibited when used defensively to hide bugs. However, `optimizer.state` is a PyTorch `defaultdict`, and this pattern correctly handles the case where:
- A parameter has no optimizer state yet (newly created, hasn't been updated)
- The parameter was removed and re-added

The subsequent `if state:` check is the appropriate way to handle this PyTorch API.

## Resolution

### Final Fix Description

No fix needed. This is documented as a verified legitimate use case.

### Verified By

- [x] Code review approved - legitimate PyTorch API usage pattern

---

## Cross-Review

| Agent | Verdict | Evaluation |
|-------|---------|------------|
| **DRL** | ENDORSE | Correct disposition - optimizer.state.get() is the canonical PyTorch pattern for accessing momentum buffers. Zeroing momentum after rollback is critical for training stability; this is not defensive programming but correct API usage. |
| **PyTorch** | ENDORSE | Correctly identifies `optimizer.state.get(p)` as legitimate - PyTorch optimizer state is a defaultdict-like structure where parameters may lack state entries until first step. This is the canonical pattern for inspecting optimizer state; marking wont-fix is the right call. |
| **CodeReview** | ENDORSE | Correct assessment that `optimizer.state.get(p)` is legitimate PyTorch API usage. The optimizer state is a defaultdict where parameters may not have state yet. Setting status to `wont-fix` is appropriate - this documents the review decision without creating unnecessary work. |
