## Summary

**One-line summary:** Uses `Any` type for `seed_state` parameter instead of proper type import.

**Category:**
- [ ] Correctness bug
- [ ] Race condition / concurrency
- [ ] Memory leak / resource issue
- [ ] Performance bottleneck
- [ ] Numerical stability
- [ ] torch.compile compatibility
- [ ] Dead code / unwired functionality
- [ ] API design / contract violation
- [ ] Test coverage gap
- [x] Documentation / naming
- [ ] Defensive programming violation
- [ ] Legacy code policy violation

## Detailed Description

### What's Wrong

```python
from typing import Any, NamedTuple, cast

# ...

def from_seed_state(seed_state: Any, ...) -> "SeedInfo":
```

Using `Any` loses type safety and IDE support. The actual type is likely `SeedState` from kasmina.

---

## Recommended Fix

Use TYPE_CHECKING import to avoid circular import at runtime:

```python
from typing import TYPE_CHECKING, NamedTuple, cast

if TYPE_CHECKING:
    from esper.kasmina.slot import SeedState

# ...

def from_seed_state(seed_state: "SeedState", ...) -> "SeedInfo":
```

---

## Verification

### How to Verify the Fix

- [ ] Add TYPE_CHECKING import
- [ ] Update parameter type annotation
- [ ] Verify no circular import issues

---

## Related Findings

None.

## Cross-Review (PyTorch Specialist)

|-------|-------|
| **Verdict** | `ENDORSE` |
| **Reviewer** | PyTorch Specialist |
| **Date** | 2024-12-27 |

**Evaluation:** No PyTorch implications - this is purely a static typing improvement. Using `TYPE_CHECKING` for the proper import is the standard Python pattern to avoid circular imports while maintaining type safety. P4 severity is appropriate as this is a minor documentation/tooling improvement with no runtime impact.

|-------|-------|
| **Verdict** | `ENDORSE` |
| **Reviewer** | Code Review Specialist |

**Evaluation:** Using `Any` type defeats static analysis and IDE support. The recommended `TYPE_CHECKING` pattern is the idiomatic Python solution for avoiding circular imports while maintaining type safety. This aligns with the project's leyline philosophy of typed contracts. Low severity (P4) is appropriate - this is polish, not urgent, but should be fixed when touching this code.

## Cross-Review (DRL Specialist)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Verdict** | `NEUTRAL` |
| **Reviewer** | DRL Specialist |

**Evaluation:** This is purely a type annotation quality issue with no impact on RL training dynamics, reward computation, or credit assignment. The `SeedInfo` extraction from `SeedState` works correctly regardless of the type annotation. While proper typing via `TYPE_CHECKING` would improve code quality, this has zero effect on policy optimization or training stability. Low priority from an RL correctness perspective.
