## Summary

**One-line summary:** Alpha override tensors created for fused validation lack `record_stream()`, risking memory corruption.

**Category:**
- [x] Correctness bug
- [x] Race condition / concurrency
- [ ] Memory leak / resource issue
- [ ] Performance bottleneck
- [ ] Numerical stability
- [ ] torch.compile compatibility
- [ ] Dead code / unwired functionality
- [ ] API design / contract violation
- [ ] Test coverage gap
- [ ] Documentation / naming
- [ ] Defensive programming violation
- [ ] Legacy code policy violation

## Detailed Description

### What's Wrong

```python
# Lines 2053-2069 (approximate)
# Alpha override tensors are created on env_state.env_device
alpha_overrides = {
    slot_id: torch.tensor([alpha], device=env_state.env_device)
    for slot_id, alpha in config.items()
}
# These tensors are used in the fused forward pass
# But record_stream() is never called on them
```

When fused validation creates alpha override tensors, they're allocated on the environment's device and used in an async CUDA stream. Without `record_stream()`, the allocator may reuse this memory before the stream completes.

### Impact

- **Memory corruption**: Alpha values could be overwritten mid-computation
- **Incorrect blending**: Seeds could be evaluated with wrong alpha weights
- **Hard to debug**: Manifests as incorrect accuracy, not crashes

---

## Recommended Fix

```python
# After creating alpha override tensors
for alpha_tensor in alpha_overrides.values():
    if env_state.stream and alpha_tensor.is_cuda:
        alpha_tensor.record_stream(env_state.stream)
```

Alternative: Preallocate alpha tensors per config at batch start to avoid per-batch allocation.

## Verification

### How to Verify the Fix

- [ ] Add `record_stream()` calls after alpha tensor creation
- [ ] Verify under CUDA memory pressure with multiple fused configs
- [ ] Check counterfactual accuracy stability across runs
