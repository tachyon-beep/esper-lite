## Summary

**One-line summary:** Ternary pattern with f-string is confusing though actually safe.

**Category:**
- [ ] Correctness bug
- [ ] Race condition / concurrency
- [ ] Memory leak / resource issue
- [ ] Performance bottleneck
- [ ] Numerical stability
- [ ] torch.compile compatibility
- [ ] Dead code / unwired functionality
- [ ] API design / contract violation
- [ ] Test coverage gap
- [x] Documentation / naming
- [ ] Defensive programming violation
- [ ] Legacy code policy violation

## Detailed Description

### What's Wrong

```python
# Lines 219-223
_logger.info(
    f"Group {group_id} training complete. "
    f"Final accuracy: {history[-1]['avg_accuracy']:.2f}%"
    if history
    else f"Group {group_id} training complete (no history)"
)
```

At first glance, it looks like `history[-1]` could raise IndexError before the `if history` check. However, Python's ternary operator short-circuits, so this is actually safe.

The confusion arises because:
1. The f-string appears to be evaluated before the condition
2. Readers unfamiliar with Python ternary may think this is a bug

### Impact

- **Reader confusion**: Pattern looks incorrect at first glance
- **Review friction**: May cause unnecessary review comments
- **Maintenance burden**: Developers may "fix" what isn't broken

---

## Recommended Fix

Use explicit if/else for clarity:

```python
if history:
    _logger.info(
        f"Group {group_id} training complete. "
        f"Final accuracy: {history[-1]['avg_accuracy']:.2f}%"
    )
else:
    _logger.info(f"Group {group_id} training complete (no history)")
```

## Verification

### How to Verify the Fix

- [ ] Refactor to explicit if/else
- [ ] Verify logging behavior unchanged
- [ ] Consider project style guide for ternary usage

### Original Report Reference

**Report file:** `docs/temp/2712reports/batch8-codereview.md`
**Section:** "[P1-1] Potential history[-1] IndexError - actually safe but confusing"

**Note:** Originally flagged as P1 but the code is actually safe. Downgraded to P4 style issue.
