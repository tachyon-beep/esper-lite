## Summary

**One-line summary:** chunk_length == max_epochs validation is redundant after __post_init__ auto-sets it.

**Category:**
- [ ] Correctness bug
- [ ] Race condition / concurrency
- [ ] Memory leak / resource issue
- [ ] Performance bottleneck
- [ ] Numerical stability
- [ ] torch.compile compatibility
- [ ] Dead code / unwired functionality
- [ ] API design / contract violation
- [ ] Test coverage gap
- [x] Documentation / naming
- [ ] Defensive programming violation
- [ ] Legacy code policy violation

## Detailed Description

### What's Wrong

```python
# Line 148-149 in __post_init__
if self.chunk_length is None:
    object.__setattr__(self, "chunk_length", self.max_epochs)

# Line 376-378 in _validate() (called after __post_init__)
if self.chunk_length != self.max_epochs:
    raise ValueError(
        "chunk_length must match max_epochs for the current training loop"
    )
```

The validation at 376-378 is redundant because:
1. If chunk_length was None, it's auto-set to max_epochs at line 149
2. If chunk_length was explicitly set differently, the validation triggers

But this creates a confusing API - users might think they can set chunk_length, only to have it fail validation.

### Impact

- **Confusing API**: Users can set chunk_length but it will fail validation
- **Redundant code**: Auto-set followed by validation of same constraint

---

## Recommended Fix

**Option 1 - Remove the field entirely:**
If chunk_length must always equal max_epochs, don't expose it as a field.

**Option 2 - Allow different values (per DRL report C8-01):**
Remove the validation to allow BPTT windows shorter than episode length.

**Option 3 - Improve error message:**
```python
raise ValueError(
    "chunk_length must match max_epochs. "
    "If not specified, chunk_length defaults to max_epochs. "
    "Different values are not currently supported."
)
```

## Verification

### How to Verify the Fix

- [ ] Decide on chunk_length policy
- [ ] Either remove field, allow different values, or improve error message
- [ ] Document the decision
