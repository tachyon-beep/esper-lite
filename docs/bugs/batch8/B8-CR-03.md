## Summary

**One-line summary:** Lazy imports inside the training loop are executed every epoch, adding overhead.

**Category:**
- [ ] Correctness bug
- [ ] Race condition / concurrency
- [ ] Memory leak / resource issue
- [x] Performance bottleneck
- [ ] Numerical stability
- [ ] torch.compile compatibility
- [ ] Dead code / unwired functionality
- [ ] API design / contract violation
- [ ] Test coverage gap
- [ ] Documentation / naming
- [ ] Defensive programming violation
- [ ] Legacy code policy violation

## Detailed Description

### What's Wrong

```python
# Lines 588-589 (inside train_ppo_vectorized)
from esper.tolaria import create_model
from esper.tamiyo import SignalTracker

# Lines 2344, 2359 (inside the epoch loop!)
from esper.kasmina.slot import SeedState
```

While lazy imports are a valid pattern to avoid circular dependencies, placing imports inside the epoch loop means they're executed every iteration. Python caches imports, but the lookup still has overhead.

### Impact

- **Micro-overhead per epoch**: Import lookup on every iteration
- **Profiling noise**: Shows up in hot path profiles
- **Unnecessary work**: Modules are already loaded after first import

---

## Recommended Fix

Hoist imports to function top level (after TYPE_CHECKING block):

```python
def train_ppo_vectorized(...):
    # Lazy imports to avoid circular dependencies, but only once per call
    from esper.tolaria import create_model
    from esper.tamiyo import SignalTracker
    from esper.kasmina.slot import SeedState

    # ... rest of function ...
    # Use SeedState directly without re-importing
```

## Verification

### How to Verify the Fix

- [ ] Move imports to function top level
- [ ] Verify no circular import errors
- [ ] Profile to confirm overhead removed
