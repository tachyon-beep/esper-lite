## Summary

**One-line summary:** `.get()` pattern for optional telemetry fields may violate project's defensive programming prohibition.

**Category:**
- [ ] Correctness bug
- [ ] Race condition / concurrency
- [ ] Memory leak / resource issue
- [ ] Performance bottleneck
- [ ] Numerical stability
- [ ] torch.compile compatibility
- [ ] Dead code / unwired functionality
- [x] API design / contract violation
- [ ] Test coverage gap
- [ ] Documentation / naming
- [x] Defensive programming violation
- [ ] Legacy code policy violation

## Detailed Description

### What's Wrong

```python
# Lines 260-268
avg_accs = [cast(float, batch["avg_accuracy"]) for batch in history]
rolling_accs = [
    cast(float, batch.get("rolling_avg_accuracy", batch.get("avg_accuracy", 0.0)))
    for batch in history
]
```

The `.get()` pattern here:
1. Falls back from `rolling_avg_accuracy` to `avg_accuracy` to `0.0`
2. This could mask bugs if `rolling_avg_accuracy` should always be present
3. Per project guidelines, defensive patterns that hide bugs are prohibited

### Evaluation Needed

This may be a legitimate case if:
- `rolling_avg_accuracy` is truly optional (added in later epochs)
- The telemetry schema explicitly allows missing fields

But if `rolling_avg_accuracy` should always exist after warmup, the `.get()` is masking a bug.

---

## Recommended Fix

**If field is optional:** Document the schema clearly and use Optional type:

```python
@dataclass
class EpochHistory:
    avg_accuracy: float
    rolling_avg_accuracy: float | None = None

# Then access with explicit None check:
rolling_acc = batch.rolling_avg_accuracy or batch.avg_accuracy
```

**If field is required:** Access directly:

```python
rolling_accs = [batch["rolling_avg_accuracy"] for batch in history]
```

---

## Verification

### How to Verify the Fix

- [ ] Determine if rolling_avg_accuracy is optional in telemetry schema
- [ ] If optional: use typed dataclass with Optional
- [ ] If required: remove .get() fallback
- [ ] Add test for field presence

## Related Findings
