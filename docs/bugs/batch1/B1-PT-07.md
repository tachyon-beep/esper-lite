## Summary

**One-line summary:** `last_good_state: dict[str, Any]` typing could be `dict[str, torch.Tensor | Any]` for better type hints.

**Category:**
- [ ] Correctness bug
- [ ] Race condition / concurrency
- [ ] Memory leak / resource issue
- [ ] Performance bottleneck
- [ ] Numerical stability
- [ ] torch.compile compatibility
- [ ] Dead code / unwired functionality
- [ ] API design / contract violation
- [ ] Test coverage gap
- [x] Documentation / naming
- [ ] Defensive programming violation
- [ ] Legacy code policy violation

## Detailed Description

### What's Wrong

The `last_good_state` attribute stores a `state_dict()` snapshot. The type hint is `dict[str, Any]` which is technically correct but doesn't convey that the values are primarily `torch.Tensor` objects.

### Code Evidence

```python
# /home/john/esper-lite/src/esper/tolaria/governor.py:71

self.last_good_state: dict[str, Any] = {}
```

### Why This Matters

1. **Type Safety:** A more specific type hint could catch type errors
2. **Documentation:** The hint conveys intent to readers
3. **Tooling:** IDEs and type checkers could provide better suggestions

However, PyTorch's `state_dict()` can contain non-Tensor values (e.g., `_metadata`, buffer scalars), so `Any` is technically correct.

---

## Recommended Fix

### Option A: More Specific Type

```python
from typing import TypeAlias

StateDict: TypeAlias = dict[str, torch.Tensor | int | float | bool | None]
self.last_good_state: StateDict = {}
```

### Option B: Keep As-Is with Comment

```python
# state_dict() values are primarily Tensor but can include metadata
self.last_good_state: dict[str, Any] = {}
```

### Verdict

**Recommend Option B** - the `Any` type is appropriate because `state_dict()` format is complex and version-dependent. Overly specific types could break with PyTorch updates.

---

## Verification

### How to Verify the Fix

- [ ] Code review: Confirm type hint is appropriate
- [ ] Optional: Add type alias if codebase uses many state dicts

---

## Cross-Review

| Agent | Verdict | Evaluation |
|-------|---------|------------|
| **DRL** | NEUTRAL | dict[str, Any] is the pragmatic choice for state_dict typing given PyTorch's internal complexity and metadata fields. Type hints on snapshots have zero impact on RL training stability; the actual rollback correctness (tested elsewhere) is what matters for training safety. |
| **PyTorch** | NEUTRAL | Using `dict[str, Any]` for state_dict is correct PyTorch idiom; state dicts contain tensors, metadata dicts, and potentially other types. Adding a more specific TypeAlias would be over-engineering and could break with PyTorch internal changes. |
| **CodeReview** | NEUTRAL | While more specific typing could help, the ticket correctly notes that `dict[str, Any]` is appropriate because `state_dict()` can contain metadata beyond tensors. Option B (keep as-is with comment) is the right call; this is documentation-level polish that adds minimal value for the maintenance cost. |
