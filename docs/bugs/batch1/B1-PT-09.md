## Summary

**One-line summary:** `if not slots:` catches both `None` and empty list - could be more explicit.

**Category:**
- [ ] Correctness bug
- [ ] Race condition / concurrency
- [ ] Memory leak / resource issue
- [ ] Performance bottleneck
- [ ] Numerical stability
- [ ] torch.compile compatibility
- [ ] Dead code / unwired functionality
- [ ] API design / contract violation
- [ ] Test coverage gap
- [x] Documentation / naming
- [ ] Defensive programming violation
- [ ] Legacy code policy violation

## Detailed Description

### What's Noted

The check `if not slots:` catches both `None` and empty list `[]`. The report suggested being more explicit:

```python
if slots is None or len(slots) == 0:
```

### Why This Is Actually Fine

The Pythonic idiom `if not slots:` is:
1. **Correct:** Catches `None`, `[]`, and any falsy value
2. **Idiomatic:** This is standard Python style
3. **Clear:** The ValueError message clarifies the requirement

The docstring already says "Required and cannot be empty" - the check matches this.

## Resolution

### Final Fix Description

**No fix needed.** The current `if not slots:` check is idiomatic Python and correctly handles all falsy cases.

More explicit checks like `if slots is None or len(slots) == 0:` add verbosity without improving correctness.

### Verified By

- [x] Code review - idiom is standard Python

## Cross-Review

| Agent | Verdict | Evaluation |
|-------|---------|------------|
| **DRL** | ENDORSE | The wont-fix verdict is correct - `if not slots:` is idiomatic Python and has zero bearing on RL training stability. Slot validation is a setup-time guard that fires before any training occurs; its stylistic form cannot affect learning dynamics, advantage estimation, or policy updates. |
| **PyTorch** | ENDORSE | Correct call to mark as wont-fix; the `if not slots:` idiom is standard Python and has zero PyTorch implications. No tensor operations, memory management, or compile compatibility concerns exist here - purely a style bikeshed. |
| **CodeReview** | ENDORSE | Correct resolution as wont-fix: `if not slots:` is idiomatic Python and correctly handles the "required and non-empty" contract. The proposed "explicit" alternative (`slots is None or len(slots) == 0`) adds verbosity without improving clarity or correctness. |
