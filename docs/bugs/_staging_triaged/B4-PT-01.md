## Summary

**One-line summary:** KL normalization uses `total_weight.clamp(min=1e-8)` - if ALL heads have zero valid timesteps, KL could theoretically explode.

**Category:**

## Detailed Description

### What's Wrong

The KL divergence computation normalizes by `total_weight`, which is clamped to a minimum of `1e-8`:

```python
# Line 683
approx_kl = (weighted_kl_sum / total_weight.clamp(min=1e-8)).item()
```

In a pathological edge case where ALL heads have zero valid timesteps (all ops are masked out), `total_weight` would be very small (exactly 0 before clamping), and the KL value could be incorrectly inflated.

### Why This Matters

- An inflated KL triggers early stopping (`if approx_kl > kl_target * 1.5`)
- This would cause premature termination of PPO updates
- Training could stall if this occurs frequently

### Current Mitigation

In practice, the `op` head always has `torch.ones_like(is_wait)` as its mask, so at least one head always has valid timesteps. This makes the edge case highly unlikely.

---

## Recommended Fix

Add an assertion or early return for the pathological case:

```python
# Before line 683
if total_weight.item() < 1e-6:
    # All heads masked out - this shouldn't happen
    logger.warning("All heads masked in KL computation, skipping early stop check")
    approx_kl = 0.0
else:
    approx_kl = (weighted_kl_sum / total_weight).item()
```

## Verification

### How to Verify the Fix

- [ ] Add assertion or warning for zero total_weight
- [ ] Add test with pathological empty masks
- [ ] Verify op head always has ones mask (guarantees non-zero weight)

## Cross-Review (DRL Specialist)

| Verdict | Reviewer | Date |
|---------|----------|------|
| **NEUTRAL** | DRL Agent | 2024-12-27 |

The edge case is structurally impossible given current causal mask design: op head always has `torch.ones_like(is_wait)` mask (line 621), guaranteeing total_weight >= 1.0.
However, adding an assertion is cheap insurance against future mask refactoring - NEUTRAL because the fix is good hygiene but the P1 severity overstates actual risk.

## Cross-Review (PyTorch Specialist)

| Verdict | Reviewer | Date |
|---------|----------|------|
| **NEUTRAL** | PyTorch Agent | 2024-12-27 |

Theoretically valid but practically unreachable: `head_masks["op"] = torch.ones_like(is_wait)` guarantees non-zero weight. The clamp at 1e-8 is standard numerical hygiene.
Recommend downgrade to P3 documentation task; no runtime fix needed since invariant is structurally enforced by the op head's unconditional mask.

## Cross-Review (Code Review Specialist)

| Verdict | Reviewer | Date |
|---------|----------|------|
| **NEUTRAL** | Code Review Specialist | 2024-12-27 |

Severity should be P3 not P1: the op head's `ones_like` mask at ppo.py:621 structurally prevents total_weight=0, making this unreachable code.
The proposed warning-based fix violates CLAUDE.md's defensive programming prohibition - if the invariant is guaranteed by design, prefer an assert over silent recovery.
