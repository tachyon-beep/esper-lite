## Summary

**One-line summary:** `metrics`, `alpha_controller`, and `alpha_algorithm` are typed as `Any` - reduces type safety benefits.

**Category:**
- [ ] Correctness bug
- [ ] Race condition / concurrency
- [ ] Memory leak / resource issue
- [ ] Performance bottleneck
- [ ] Numerical stability
- [ ] torch.compile compatibility
- [ ] Dead code / unwired functionality
- [x] API design / contract violation
- [ ] Test coverage gap
- [ ] Documentation / naming
- [ ] Defensive programming violation
- [ ] Legacy code policy violation

## Detailed Description

### What's Wrong

The `SeedStateProtocol` uses `Any` for several fields:

```python
class SeedStateProtocol(Protocol):
    metrics: Any  # Should be SeedMetrics or a Protocol
    alpha_controller: Any  # Should be AlphaController Protocol
    alpha_algorithm: Any  # Should be AlphaAlgorithm Protocol
```

Using `Any` defeats the purpose of protocol-based decoupling - the type checker can't verify that callers use these fields correctly.

### Why This Is Acceptable (Currently)

- Avoids circular imports between simic and kasmina
- The actual implementations are in kasmina, which simic shouldn't depend on directly
- Runtime behavior is correct

---

## Recommended Fix

Define minimal protocols for these fields:

```python
class SeedMetricsProtocol(Protocol):
    """Minimal interface for seed metrics."""
    epochs_total: int
    epochs_in_current_stage: int
    accuracy_at_start: float
    accuracy_current: float

class AlphaControllerProtocol(Protocol):
    """Minimal interface for alpha controller."""
    def get_alpha(self) -> float: ...
    def set_target(self, target: float, speed: float, curve: str) -> None: ...

class SeedStateProtocol(Protocol):
    metrics: SeedMetricsProtocol
    alpha_controller: AlphaControllerProtocol
    # ...
```

---

## Verification

### How to Verify the Fix

- [ ] Define minimal protocol interfaces for each `Any` field
- [ ] Update SeedStateProtocol to use these protocols
- [ ] Run mypy to verify type consistency

## Cross-Review

| Agent | Verdict | Evaluation |
|-------|---------|------------|
| **PyTorch** | NEUTRAL | No PyTorch runtime implications - `Any` types do not affect compiled graph structure or tensor operations. Type safety concern is valid for static analysis but has zero impact on `torch.compile`, memory layout, or numerical behavior. |
| **DRL** | ENDORSE | The `Any`-typed fields reduce static checking for PPO's interaction with seed state (e.g., `alpha_controller.get_alpha()` calls). Defining minimal protocols for `SeedMetrics` and `AlphaController` would catch interface mismatches at type-check time rather than during training runs. |
| **CodeReview** | ENDORSE | Valid finding - `Any` types in protocols defeat the purpose of protocol-based decoupling. The recommended fix of defining minimal `SeedMetricsProtocol` and `AlphaControllerProtocol` in simic.contracts.py is the correct approach to avoid circular imports while restoring type safety for consumers. |
