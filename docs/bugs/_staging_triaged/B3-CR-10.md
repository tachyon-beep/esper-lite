## Summary

**One-line summary:** `_invalidate_action_cache` catches `AttributeError` silently - could mask real bugs if `_action_enum_cache` is renamed.

**Category:**
- [ ] Correctness bug
- [ ] Race condition / concurrency
- [ ] Memory leak / resource issue
- [ ] Performance bottleneck
- [ ] Numerical stability
- [ ] torch.compile compatibility
- [ ] Dead code / unwired functionality
- [ ] API design / contract violation
- [ ] Test coverage gap
- [x] Documentation / naming
- [ ] Defensive programming violation
- [ ] Legacy code policy violation

## Detailed Description

### What's Wrong

The cache invalidation catches `AttributeError` silently. While documented as "best-effort", if the leyline module's cache attribute is renamed, this would silently fail to invalidate.

### Code Evidence

```python
# /home/john/esper-lite/src/esper/kasmina/blueprints/registry.py:33-34

try:
    del leyline.actions._action_enum_cache  # Best-effort invalidation
except AttributeError:
    pass  # Silent!
```

---

## Recommended Fix

Log a debug message to aid troubleshooting:

```python
try:
    del leyline.actions._action_enum_cache
except AttributeError:
    pass  # Cache may not exist yet; this is expected on first registration
```

Or use hasattr explicitly:

```python
cache_name = "_action_enum_cache"
if hasattr(leyline.actions, cache_name):
    delattr(leyline.actions, cache_name)
```

---

## Verification

### How to Verify the Fix

- [ ] Add debug logging
- [ ] Add test that verifies cache invalidation works

Per CLAUDE.md "Prohibition on Defensive Programming Patterns", silent exception swallowing masks bugs rather than fixing them.
The current code already logs at DEBUG level (line 34) which is appropriate; the ticket's code evidence appears outdated.

## Cross-Review (DRL Specialist)

| Verdict | Reviewer | Date |
|---------|----------|------|
| **NEUTRAL** | drl-expert | 2024-12-27 |

Cache invalidation is a registration-time operation with no training-loop impact. Silent failure would cause stale action enums but this is a correctness bug in policy action interpretation, not a gradient flow or numerical stability issue.
Debug logging is reasonable but low priority for RL training health.

## Cross-Review (Code Quality)

| Verdict | Reviewer | Date |
|---------|----------|------|
| **OBJECT** | cross-review-specialist | 2024-12-27 |

The ticket's code evidence is stale - the actual code at lines 33-34 ALREADY includes `_logger.debug("Cache invalidation skipped: %s", e)`.
Recommend closing as already-fixed or updating the ticket to reflect current state; no action required on the codebase.
