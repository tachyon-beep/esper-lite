## Summary

**One-line summary:** `ParallelEnvState` is the only import from the training submodule at package level - verify no circular import risk.

## Detailed Description

### What's Wrong

The simic package `__init__.py` imports from the training submodule:

```python
from esper.simic.training import ParallelEnvState
```

This is the only import from `training` at the package level. Other heavy modules like `PPOAgent` and `train_ppo_vectorized` use lazy imports (noted in comments).

### Potential Risk

If `training.py` imports from `simic.__init__`, there could be a circular import. However, looking at the module structure, `training.py` should only import from `simic.agent` directly, not from `simic.__init__`.

---

## Recommended Fix

Verify the import chain:

```bash
# Check if training imports from simic.__init__
grep -n "from esper.simic import" src/esper/simic/training/
```

If safe, add a comment:

```python
# ParallelEnvState is lightweight and has no circular import risk
from esper.simic.training import ParallelEnvState
```

---

## Verification

### How to Verify the Fix

- [ ] Verify no circular import exists
- [ ] Add clarifying comment if safe
- [ ] Run `python -c "from esper.simic import *"` to test

## Cross-Review (DRL Specialist)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Verdict** | `ENDORSE` |
| **Reviewer** | DRL Specialist |

**Evaluation:** Valid architectural hygiene concern. ParallelEnvState is indeed lightweight (state container only), and the import chain is safe - training imports from simic.agent, not simic.__init__. Adding a clarifying comment would prevent future confusion about the asymmetric import pattern (ParallelEnvState eager vs PPOAgent lazy).

## Cross-Review (PyTorch Specialist)

|-------|-------|
| **Verdict** | `ENDORSE` |
| **Reviewer** | PyTorch Specialist |
| **Date** | 2024-12-27 |

**Evaluation:** No circular import risk exists - verified `training/__init__.py` does not import from `simic.__init__`. ParallelEnvState contains only dataclass fields with TYPE_CHECKING guards for heavy types. Suggested comment is appropriate; additionally note that `torch.cuda.Stream` is lazily created (line 43), so no GPU context pollution at import time.
