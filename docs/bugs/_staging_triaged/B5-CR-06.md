## Summary

**One-line summary:** `.get(slot_id, 0.0)` could hide integration bugs if slot_id is misspelled or missing.

**Category:**
- [ ] Correctness bug
- [ ] Race condition / concurrency
- [ ] Memory leak / resource issue
- [ ] Performance bottleneck
- [ ] Numerical stability
- [ ] torch.compile compatibility
- [ ] Dead code / unwired functionality
- [ ] API design / contract violation
- [ ] Test coverage gap
- [ ] Documentation / naming
- [x] Defensive programming violation
- [ ] Legacy code policy violation

## Detailed Description

### What's Wrong

```python
return self._marginal_contributions.get(slot_id, 0.0)
```

Per CLAUDE.md, this could hide a bug if `slot_id` is incorrectly spelled or the slot wasn't in the original computation.

### Consideration

Returning 0.0 for unknown slots may be legitimate (graceful degradation for partial matrices). However, this should be a documented design decision, not silent default behavior.

---

## Recommended Fix

Either fail-fast or document the design choice:

**Option 1 - Fail-fast (preferred per project policy):**
```python
def marginal_contribution(self, slot_id: str) -> float:
    """Get marginal contribution for a slot.

    Raises:
        KeyError: If slot_id was not part of the computation.
    """
    return self._marginal_contributions[slot_id]
```

**Option 2 - Document the graceful behavior:**
```python
def marginal_contribution(self, slot_id: str) -> float:
    """Get marginal contribution for a slot.

    Returns:
        Marginal contribution value, or 0.0 if slot was not in computation.
        The 0.0 default enables partial matrices where not all slots are evaluated.
    """
    return self._marginal_contributions.get(slot_id, 0.0)
```

## Verification

### How to Verify the Fix

- [ ] Decide on fail-fast vs graceful behavior
- [ ] Update implementation and docstring
- [ ] Add test for missing slot_id case

| **Date** | 2024-12-27 |

**Evaluation:** From a PyTorch perspective, fail-fast is strongly preferred here. In attribution/counterfactual contexts, silently returning 0.0 for an unknown slot could corrupt gradient attribution calculations or Shapley value computations without any visible error. The marginal contribution lookup is not a hot path where exception overhead matters, so direct dict access with KeyError is the correct pattern.

## Cross-Review (DRL Specialist)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Verdict** | `ENDORSE` |
| **Reviewer** | DRL Specialist |

**Evaluation:** From an RL perspective, marginal contributions in counterfactual attribution are critical for understanding slot value in the policy. Silently returning 0.0 for missing slots could mask reward attribution bugs where a slot that should be contributing is being ignored due to a typo or misconfigured slot registry. I strongly prefer Option 1 (fail-fast) because in RL training, silent zeros in attribution can lead to incorrect credit assignment that compounds over episodes, making the root cause extremely difficult to diagnose.

**Evaluation:** This finding directly aligns with the project's "No Defensive Programming" policy in CLAUDE.md, which explicitly prohibits `.get()` patterns that hide bugs. The code at line 123 uses `.get(slot_id, 0.0)` which would silently return 0.0 for misspelled slot IDs or slots not in the computation - exactly the anti-pattern the policy forbids. Option 1 (fail-fast with direct dict access) is the correct fix per project standards; Option 2 (documented graceful degradation) would only be acceptable if there's a genuine business requirement for partial matrices, which should be rare.
