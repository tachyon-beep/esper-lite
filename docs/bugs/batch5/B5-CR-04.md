## Detailed Description

### What's Wrong

`_device` is stored as `str` but `device` property returns `torch.device` from tensor:

```python
def to(self, device: str | torch.device) -> "RunningMeanStd":
    ...
    self._device = str(device)  # Normalizes to string
    return self

@property
def device(self) -> torch.device:
    return self.mean.device  # Returns torch.device from tensor
```

The `_device` field is redundant since we can always get the authoritative device from `self.mean.device`.

---

## Recommended Fix

Consider removing `_device` field since `self.mean.device` is authoritative:

```python
def __init__(self, ...):
    # Remove: self._device = str(device)
    ...

def to(self, device: str | torch.device) -> "RunningMeanStd":
    target = torch.device(device) if isinstance(device, str) else device
    self.mean = self.mean.to(target)
    self.var = self.var.to(target)
    self.count = self.count.to(target)
    # Remove: self._device = str(device)
    return self
```

## Verification

### How to Verify the Fix

- [ ] Remove _device field
- [ ] Update load_state_dict to use self.mean.device
- [ ] Verify tests still pass

**Evaluation:** This is a valid code quality issue. Storing redundant state (`_device` as `str`) when the authoritative source (`self.mean.device`) is always available creates potential for desynchronization bugs. The DRY principle applies here - remove the redundant field and derive device from the tensor. This also aligns with the project's no-legacy-code policy against keeping unnecessary fields.

**Evaluation:** Strongly endorse removing `_device` as redundant state. In PyTorch, the tensor's `.device` property is always authoritative and up-to-date; maintaining a parallel `_device` field creates risk of desynchronization (e.g., if tensors are moved via in-place operations or CUDA context switches). The pattern `self.mean.device` is the idiomatic PyTorch approach and works correctly with `torch.compile`, device moves, and checkpoint loading. Removing the redundant field eliminates a potential source of subtle device placement bugs.

## Cross-Review (DRL Specialist)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Verdict** | `ENDORSE` |
| **Reviewer** | DRL Specialist |

**Evaluation:** RunningMeanStd is critical infrastructure for observation normalization in RL, and device handling bugs can cause silent tensor misplacement that degrades training performance or causes crashes mid-run. The redundant `_device` field creates potential for device state drift between the string cache and actual tensor device. Using `self.mean.device` as the single source of truth is the correct pattern and eliminates a class of potential bugs during checkpoint loading.
