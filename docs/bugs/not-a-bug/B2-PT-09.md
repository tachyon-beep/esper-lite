## Summary

**One-line summary:** Step assignment at L177 is immediately overwritten by conditional at L179, creating redundant code.

**Category:**
- [ ] Correctness bug
- [ ] Race condition / concurrency
- [ ] Memory leak / resource issue
- [ ] Performance bottleneck
- [ ] Numerical stability
- [ ] torch.compile compatibility
- [ ] Dead code / unwired functionality
- [ ] API design / contract violation
- [ ] Test coverage gap
- [x] Documentation / naming
- [ ] Defensive programming violation
- [ ] Legacy code policy violation

## Detailed Description

### What's Wrong

The pattern `step = X` followed immediately by `step if step is not None else self._current_step` is redundant - the first assignment is never used if step was passed as an argument.

### Code Evidence

```python
# /home/john/esper-lite/src/esper/kasmina/blending.py:177-179

step = step  # Assigned from parameter
current = step if step is not None else self._current_step  # Immediately re-evaluated
```

### Impact

Minor style issue - no performance or correctness impact.

---

## Recommended Fix

Simplify to:

```python
current = step if step is not None else self._current_step
```

## Cross-Review

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Reviewer** | `drl` |
| **Verdict** | `OBJECT` |

**Evaluation:** The ticket misreads the code: L177 updates internal state `_current_step` as a side-effect, L179 resolves fallback -- not redundant.
This is correct stateful alpha scheduling for blending; the pattern intentionally separates mutation from resolution.

---

## Resolution

### Status: NOT-A-BUG

**Closed via Systematic Debugging investigation. Cross-review objection confirmed.**

#### Why This Is Not A Bug

The ticket misread the code. The actual pattern is:

```python
# Lines 200-203 (shifted from original 177-179)
if step is not None:
    self._current_step = step  # SIDE EFFECT: update instance state

current = step if step is not None else self._current_step  # RESOLUTION
```

| Claim | Status | Evidence |
|-------|--------|----------|
| "`step = step`" at L177 | ❌ FALSE | Actual code is `self._current_step = step` |
| "Redundant assignment" | ❌ FALSE | First is mutation, second is resolution |
| Line numbers 177/179 | ❌ STALE | Now at lines 200-203 |

#### The Intentional Pattern

This is a **stateful caching pattern**:

1. **Line 200-201**: Side effect - saves step to instance state for future calls
2. **Line 203**: Resolution - determines value for THIS calculation

When calling `get_alpha(step=5)`, it saves the step. Future calls to `get_alpha()` (no args) reuse that saved step. This is intentional for alpha scheduling.

#### Cross-Review Validation

The DRL specialist's objection was correct. The pattern "intentionally separates mutation from resolution" as they noted.

#### Severity Assessment

- Original: P4 (Documentation / naming)
- Revised: N/A (Not a bug - ticket misread the code)
- Resolution: NOT-A-BUG
