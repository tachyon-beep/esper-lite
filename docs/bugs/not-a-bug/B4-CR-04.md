## Summary

**One-line summary:** FOSSILIZE and ADVANCE operations are documented in docstring but not explicitly computed as boolean masks - handled implicitly via `~is_wait`.

**Category:**
- [ ] Correctness bug
- [ ] Race condition / concurrency
- [ ] Memory leak / resource issue
- [ ] Performance bottleneck
- [ ] Numerical stability
- [ ] torch.compile compatibility
- [ ] Dead code / unwired functionality
- [ ] API design / contract violation
- [ ] Test coverage gap
- [x] Documentation / naming
- [ ] Defensive programming violation
- [ ] Legacy code policy violation

## Detailed Description

### What's Wrong

The docstring (lines 17-34) documents FOSSILIZE and ADVANCE operations in the decision tree, but the implementation only computes:
- `is_wait`
- `is_germinate`
- `is_set_alpha`
- `is_prune`

FOSSILIZE and ADVANCE are handled implicitly via `slot_mask = ~is_wait`.

### Code Evidence

```python
# Lines 60-68
is_wait = op_actions == LifecycleOp.WAIT
is_germinate = op_actions == LifecycleOp.GERMINATE
is_set_alpha = op_actions == LifecycleOp.SET_ALPHA_TARGET
is_prune = op_actions == LifecycleOp.PRUNE

# slot head: relevant for GERMINATE, FOSSILIZE, PRUNE, ADVANCE
slot_mask = ~is_wait  # Implicit handling of FOSSILIZE and ADVANCE
```

### Why This Is Acceptable

The implementation is CORRECT - `~is_wait` covers all non-WAIT operations including FOSSILIZE and ADVANCE. The issue is stylistic: the asymmetry between documented ops and computed booleans reduces clarity.

---

## Recommended Fix

Add explicit booleans for documentation purposes (optional):

```python
# Explicit boolean masks for clarity (match docstring)
is_wait = op_actions == LifecycleOp.WAIT
is_germinate = op_actions == LifecycleOp.GERMINATE
is_fossilize = op_actions == LifecycleOp.FOSSILIZE
is_advance = op_actions == LifecycleOp.ADVANCE
is_set_alpha = op_actions == LifecycleOp.SET_ALPHA_TARGET
is_prune = op_actions == LifecycleOp.PRUNE

# slot head: all non-WAIT ops need slot selection
slot_mask = is_germinate | is_fossilize | is_advance | is_set_alpha | is_prune
```

Or simply add a comment explaining the implicit handling:

```python
# slot head: relevant for all non-WAIT ops (GERMINATE, FOSSILIZE, PRUNE, ADVANCE, SET_ALPHA_TARGET)
# Using ~is_wait as shorthand since all operations except WAIT need slot selection
slot_mask = ~is_wait
```

## Verification

### How to Verify the Fix

- [ ] Add clarifying comment or explicit booleans
- [ ] Verify tests still pass
- [ ] No functional change needed

## Cross-Review

| Agent | Verdict | Evaluation |
|-------|---------|------------|
| **PyTorch** | NEUTRAL | No PyTorch implications - the `~is_wait` pattern compiles identically to explicit ORs after Dynamo fusion. Documentation-only concern with no performance, correctness, or `torch.compile` impact. |
| **DRL** | ENDORSE | The implicit `~is_wait` is semantically correct and idiomatic for causal masking in factored action spaces. Explicit booleans for FOSSILIZE/ADVANCE would add clarity without affecting gradient computation, making this a low-risk documentation improvement. |
| **CodeReview** | NEUTRAL | The implicit handling via `~is_wait` is semantically correct and the docstring accurately documents all operations. Adding explicit booleans would add 4 unused variables solely for documentation purposes, increasing code size without improving correctness. A brief inline comment is sufficient. |
