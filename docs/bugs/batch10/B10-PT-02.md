## Summary

**One-line summary:** Warning comment says not to call `.to(device)` after compile, but there's no enforcement.

**Category:**
- [x] Correctness bug
- [ ] Race condition / concurrency
- [ ] Memory leak / resource issue
- [ ] Performance bottleneck
- [ ] Numerical stability
- [x] torch.compile compatibility
- [ ] Dead code / unwired functionality
- [x] API design / contract violation
- [ ] Test coverage gap
- [ ] Documentation / naming
- [ ] Defensive programming violation
- [ ] Legacy code policy violation

## Detailed Description

### What's Wrong

```python
# Lines 98-104 in factory.py
# Device placement BEFORE compile - critical for trace correctness
policy.to(device)

if compile_mode is not None:
    policy.compile(mode=compile_mode)
    # WARNING: Do not call .to(device) after this point!
```

The factory correctly places device before compile. However:

1. If a caller does `policy = create_policy(...).to(other_device)`, the compiled module would be replaced/invalidated
2. The warning comment is only visible to those reading the factory source
3. No runtime enforcement prevents post-compile device moves

### Impact

- **Silent compilation invalidation**: Compiled module replaced with eager version
- **Performance regression**: User thinks they're getting compiled speedup but aren't
- **Subtle bugs**: Trace may have captured wrong device

---

## Recommended Fix

Options:

1. **Override `to()` to warn/error post-compile**:
```python
class LSTMPolicyBundle:
    def to(self, device: torch.device | str, *args, **kwargs) -> Self:
        if self.is_compiled:
            raise RuntimeError(
                "Cannot move compiled policy to new device. "
                "Create a new policy with the desired device instead."
            )
        self._network = self._network.to(device, *args, **kwargs)
        return self
```

2. **Document in class docstring** (minimal):
   - Add clear warning at class level about post-compile device moves

3. **Freeze the policy object after compile**:
   - Return a wrapper that blocks attribute modifications

---

## Verification

### How to Verify the Fix

- [ ] Add override for `.to()` that checks `is_compiled`
- [ ] Add test that verifies error is raised on post-compile device move
- [ ] Document constraint at class and factory level

## Related Findings

None.
