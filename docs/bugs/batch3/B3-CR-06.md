## Summary

**One-line summary:** `_cached_alpha_tensor` invalidation is scattered across multiple methods (`set_alpha`, `prune`, `force_alpha`, `to`) - maintenance burden.

**Category:**
- [ ] Correctness bug
- [ ] Race condition / concurrency
- [ ] Memory leak / resource issue
- [ ] Performance bottleneck
- [ ] Numerical stability
- [ ] torch.compile compatibility
- [ ] Dead code / unwired functionality
- [ ] API design / contract violation
- [ ] Test coverage gap
- [x] Documentation / naming
- [ ] Defensive programming violation
- [ ] Legacy code policy violation

## Detailed Description

### What's Wrong

The alpha tensor cache must be invalidated when:
- Alpha value changes (`set_alpha`)
- Slot is pruned (`prune`)
- Alpha is temporarily forced (`force_alpha`)
- Device changes (`.to()`)

This logic is scattered across multiple methods.

### Code Evidence

```python
# Multiple locations:
self._cached_alpha_tensor = None  # Scattered invalidation
```

### Why This Matters

- Easy to miss an invalidation site when adding new methods
- Risk of stale cache serving wrong alpha values
- Maintenance burden

---

## Recommended Fix

Centralize cache management:

```python
def _invalidate_alpha_cache(self) -> None:
    """Clear cached alpha tensor. Call when alpha, device, or dtype changes."""
    self._cached_alpha_tensor = None

# Then use consistently:
def set_alpha(self, value: float) -> None:
    self._alpha = value
    self._invalidate_alpha_cache()
```

---

## Verification

### How to Verify the Fix

- [ ] Identify all cache invalidation sites
- [ ] Extract to single method
- [ ] Add test for cache consistency

## Cross-Review: PyTorch Specialist

| Verdict | Evaluation |
|---------|------------|
| **ENDORSE** | Cache invalidation scattered across 5 sites is a compile-safety hazard; a missed invalidation yields stale device/dtype tensors causing silent wrong results. Centralizing to `_invalidate_alpha_cache()` also documents the compile-visible state mutation. |

---

## Cross-Review: DRL Specialist

| Verdict | Evaluation |
|---------|------------|
| **ENDORSE** | Stale alpha cache is a **silent training bug** - wrong blending coefficients cause policy gradients to be computed against incorrect advantage baselines. The 5-site scattered invalidation is a maintenance hazard. Consider elevating to P1 given RL correctness implications. |

## Cross-Review: Code Review Specialist

| Verdict | Evaluation |
|---------|------------|
| **ENDORSE** | Verified 5 invalidation sites (lines 1113, 1170, 1185, 1582, 2026). Each has inline comments, but the `_invalidate_alpha_cache()` extraction would reduce future omission risk. Low-effort refactor with defensive value. |
