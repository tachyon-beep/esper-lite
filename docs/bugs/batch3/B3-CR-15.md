## Summary

**One-line summary:** Telemetry payload construction is verbose and repeated in ~8 locations.

**Category:**
- [ ] Correctness bug
- [ ] Race condition / concurrency
- [ ] Memory leak / resource issue
- [ ] Performance bottleneck
- [ ] Numerical stability
- [ ] torch.compile compatibility
- [ ] Dead code / unwired functionality
- [ ] API design / contract violation
- [ ] Test coverage gap
- [x] Documentation / naming
- [ ] Defensive programming violation
- [ ] Legacy code policy violation

## Detailed Description

### What's Wrong

The `SeedStageChangedPayload` and related telemetry payloads are constructed with nearly identical code in prune(), advance_stage(), step_epoch(), schedule_prune(), set_alpha_target(), and others. This is ~30 lines repeated in each location.

### Why This Matters

- Changes to payload structure require updates in many places
- Risk of inconsistency between emission sites
- Contributes to slot.py being ~2600 lines

---

## Recommended Fix

Extract helper methods:

```python
def _make_stage_change_payload(
    self,
    old_stage: SeedStage,
    new_stage: SeedStage,
    trigger: str,
) -> SeedStageChangedPayload:
    """Common telemetry payload construction."""
    return SeedStageChangedPayload(
        env_id=-1,  # Replaced by emit_with_env_context
        slot_index=self.slot_index,
        old_stage=old_stage,
        new_stage=new_stage,
        blueprint_name=self.state.blueprint_name,
        # ... common fields
    )
```

---

## Verification

### How to Verify the Fix

- [ ] Extract common payload construction
- [ ] Verify all emission sites use helper
- [ ] Run telemetry tests

## Cross-Review

|-------|-------|
| **Verdict** | ENDORSE |
| **Reviewer** | cross-review-agent |
| **Date** | 2024-12-27 |

**Evaluation:** Confirmed 7 instances of near-identical ~25-line `SeedStageChangedPayload` construction with repeated gradient health field patterns.
Extracting `_make_stage_change_payload()` helper is a clear DRY win that reduces maintenance burden and inconsistency risk.

**Evaluation:** Dataclass instantiation is outside hot paths with no torch.compile or CUDA implications - pure code hygiene.
Preserve conditional telemetry field access pattern (`if self.state.telemetry and epoch > 0`) verbatim in any extracted helper.

## Cross-Review (DRL Specialist)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Verdict** | `ENDORSE` |
| **Reviewer** | DRL Specialist |
| **Date** | 2024-12-27 |

**Evaluation:** Confirmed 7 repetitions of identical ~25-line payload construction including gradient health fields (grad_ratio, has_vanishing, has_exploding). No direct RL training impact, but telemetry consistency matters for diagnosing training issues - a helper method reduces risk of divergent gradient health reporting across stage transitions.
