## Summary

**One-line summary:** `_blueprints` is a class variable (mutable singleton) - safe for single-process but problematic if module is reloaded or in multiprocessing contexts.

**Category:**
- [ ] Correctness bug
- [ ] Race condition / concurrency
- [ ] Memory leak / resource issue
- [x] Performance bottleneck
- [ ] Numerical stability
- [ ] torch.compile compatibility
- [ ] Dead code / unwired functionality
- [x] API design / contract violation
- [ ] Test coverage gap
- [ ] Documentation / naming
- [ ] Defensive programming violation
- [ ] Legacy code policy violation

## Detailed Description

### What's Wrong

The blueprint registry uses a class-level mutable dict as a singleton. This is fine for single-process usage but could cause issues:
- Module reload resets the registry
- Forked multiprocessing may have stale registrations

### Code Evidence

```python
# /home/john/esper-lite/src/esper/kasmina/blueprints/registry.py:56

_blueprints: dict[str, BlueprintSpec] = {}  # Class-level mutable
```

### Why This Is Currently Acceptable

- Blueprints are registered at import time
- Single-process training is the norm
- Tests use `unregister()` for isolation

---

## Recommended Fix

Document the constraint:

```python
class BlueprintRegistry:
    """Singleton registry for seed blueprints.

    Warning:
        This is a class-level singleton. Do not use across forked processes
        or after module reloads. For multiprocessing, ensure blueprints are
        registered in each worker.
    """
    _blueprints: dict[str, BlueprintSpec] = {}
```

## Verification

### How to Verify the Fix

- [ ] Add docstring documenting singleton behavior
- [ ] Add test verifying registry behavior after fork (if applicable)

## Cross-Review

| Reviewer | Verdict | Evaluation |
|----------|---------|------------|
| DRL Expert | **OBJECT** | Class-level mutable dict is the *standard* Python registry pattern. Blueprints are registered at import time via decorators and never mutate during training. Forked multiprocessing re-imports the module, so registrations are fresh. This is not a bug; downgrade to P4/Won't Fix. |
| PyTorch Specialist | **NEUTRAL** | Class-level mutable dict is the standard Python singleton pattern and works correctly for PyTorch's single-process-per-GPU model. Forked multiprocessing re-imports modules anyway. The concern is theoretical; document if desired but not a real issue. |
| Code Review Specialist | **NEUTRAL** | This is a standard Python registry singleton pattern; all major frameworks (torch, pytest) use class-level dicts. The ticket's own "Why This Is Currently Acceptable" section acknowledges it's fine for current usage. Downgrade to P3 documentation task. |
