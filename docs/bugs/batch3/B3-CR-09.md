## Summary

**One-line summary:** `type: ignore[no-any-return]` comments on return statements indicate missing return type annotations in torch stubs.

**Category:**
- [ ] Correctness bug
- [ ] Race condition / concurrency
- [ ] Memory leak / resource issue
- [ ] Performance bottleneck
- [ ] Numerical stability
- [ ] torch.compile compatibility
- [ ] Dead code / unwired functionality
- [ ] API design / contract violation
- [ ] Test coverage gap
- [x] Documentation / naming
- [ ] Defensive programming violation
- [ ] Legacy code policy violation

## Detailed Description

### What's Wrong

Several return statements have `# type: ignore[no-any-return]` comments. These are likely due to incomplete torch type stubs.

### Why This Is Acceptable

- PyTorch type stubs are notoriously incomplete
- The ignores are specific (`no-any-return`), not blanket ignores
- Warrants monitoring as PyTorch stubs improve

---

## Resolution

**Acceptable as-is** - Monitor and remove as torch stubs improve.

These ignores target specific PyTorch return types (`Tensor + Tensor` arithmetic) that mypy cannot infer due to stub gaps.
No torch.compile or runtime implications; purely static analysis noise that will resolve as typeshed/pytorch-stubs mature.

Type ignores on tensor arithmetic have zero RL training impact - these are cosmetic stub gaps, not gradient/numerical issues.
The return expressions (e.g., `x + torch.tanh(self.scale) * ...`) are standard residual connections that propagate gradients correctly regardless of type annotations.

## Cross-Review (Code Quality)

| Verdict | Reviewer | Date |
|---------|----------|------|
| **ENDORSE** | cross-review-specialist | 2024-12-27 |

The `type: ignore[no-any-return]` comments are narrowly scoped and appropriate for PyTorch's incomplete stubs.
Original assessment is correct - these are legitimate tensor operations with well-known stub limitations, not actual type safety issues.
