# Jace — Prototype Delta (Out of Scope for Esper‑Lite)

Lead note: The intended scope for the Esper‑Lite prototype does not include Jace. This is a placeholder acknowledging the full design (`docs/design/detailed_design/11-jace-unified-design.md` and `11.1`–`11.3`), but no implementation is planned for this prototype.

Summary (design reference only): Jace specifies testing frameworks, circuit‑breaker validation suites, and an SLO framework. In Esper‑Lite, these capabilities are covered by subsystem unit/integration tests and lightweight alerting/SLO tracking in Nissa.

Status: Not applicable for the prototype; no code artefacts in `src/`.
