# Elesh — Prototype Delta (Out of Scope for Esper‑Lite)

Lead note: The intended scope for the Esper‑Lite prototype does not include Elesh. This is a placeholder acknowledging the full design (`docs/design/detailed_design/13-elesh-unified-design.md` and `13.1`/`13.2`), but no implementation is planned for this prototype.

Summary (design reference only): Elesh specifies importance tracking and analysis algorithms. In Esper‑Lite, such analyses are deferred; basic telemetry and SLOs in Nissa provide sufficient operational visibility.

Status: Not applicable for the prototype; no code artefacts in `src/`.
