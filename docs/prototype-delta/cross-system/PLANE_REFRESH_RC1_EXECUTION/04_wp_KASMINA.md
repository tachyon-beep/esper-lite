# Work Package â€” Kasmina Execution Remediation (WP-K)

## Context
Key findings from `KASMINA_REVIEW_FINDINGS.md`, delta docs, and `lint_static_analysis.md`:
- Fallback kernels mask failures; gate inputs ignore fallback/stage expectations.
- Confidence/channels blending uses activations; lacks telemetry, size limits.
- Prefetch uses placeholder training IDs, blocks on event loop assumptions.
- Command verifier lacks telemetry; nonce ledger growth unmanaged.
- Complexity hotspots: `KasminaSeedManager.handle_command` (F/51), `_graft_seed` (D/22), blend annotations/resume (C), etc.

## Work Streams
| ID | Goal |
|----|------|
| WP-K1 | Gate & fallback enforcement |
| WP-K2 | Blending & isolation upgrades |
| WP-K3 | Command/security/telemetry hardening |
| WP-K4 | Prefetch/cache reliability |

### WP-K1 â€” Gate & Fallback Enforcement
Tasks:
1. Make fallback kernel assignment a gate failure; emit CRITICAL telemetry per prototype policy.
2. Enforce expected stage in gate inputs; fail when telemetry stage mismatch.
3. Update G2/G4 to react to fallback_used/performance_status.
4. Add tests for gate failures and fallback handling.
5. Land the command dispatcher scaffolding (see `kasmina_command_dispatcher_refactor_plan.md`) so seed handling routes through explicit helpers with strict-failure semantics.
Acceptance:
- Gate tests confirm fallback seeds are culled/embargoed.
- Telemetry shows gate_failure events with reason.
Risks:
- Behaviour change affects Tamiyo/Tolaria; coordinate messaging.

Status:
- âœ… Completed 2025-09-28 â€” Dispatcher is authoritative, fallbacks now raise `DependencyViolationError`, and CRITICAL `gate_failure` telemetry is emitted. Coverage: `pytest tests/kasmina/test_seed_manager.py`, `pytest tests/kasmina/test_command_dispatcher.py`, `pytest tests/integration/test_control_loop.py::test_kasmina_emits_one_packet_per_seed_per_step`.

### WP-K2 â€” Blending & Isolation Upgrades
Tasks:
1. Ensure confidence gating receives Tamiyo logits; remove activation-based fallback.
2. Add blend telemetry (mode, alpha mean/p95, sparsity, gate stats).
3. Limit alpha_vec length; fail invalid annotations.
4. Normalise isolation verify: compute cosine similarity, reduce projection memory.
5. Reduce complexity (`handle_command`, `_graft_seed`, `_resume_seed`) to â‰¤ C via helper classes.
Acceptance:
- Unit tests for blend annotations/logit gating pass.
- Isolation telemetry reflects cosine values; memory footprint stable.
Risks:
- Requires Tamiyo to emit logits; ensure dependency tracked in WP-A2.
- Refactor touches large code paths; incremental PRs recommended.

Status:
- âœ… Completed 2025-09-28 â€” `_BlendManager` enforces logits/alpha_vec bounds, telemetry includes blend metadata, and isolation monitoring remains intact. Coverage: `pytest tests/kasmina/test_blend_annotations.py`, `pytest tests/kasmina/test_seed_manager.py`.

### WP-K3 â€” Command/Security/Telemetry
Tasks:
1. Hook command verifier failures to telemetry; emit `command_rejected` at `TelemetryLevel.CRITICAL` (priority CRITICAL) for `{missing_signature, invalid_signature, nonce_replayed, missing_timestamp, stale_command}` and attach reason/command_id attributes.
2. Add periodic nonce cleanup with configurable TTL (default 300â€¯s), hard cap (10â€¯k entries), and expose gauges/counters (`kasmina.nonce_ledger.size`, `kasmina.nonce_ledger.evictions_total`, `kasmina.nonce_ledger.ttl_seconds`).
3. Provide teacher deregistration/reset entry points that clear the nonce ledger and seed registry consistently before accepting new commands.
4. Update telemetry helpers to publish verifier acceptance/rejection counters, nonce ledger truncation warnings, and blend mode/clamping metadata.
Acceptance:
- Telemetry logs `command_rejected` with critical priority for security failures; metrics counters/gauges exported and asserted in tests.
- Registry tests cover teacher swaps and ensure nonce ledger reset hooks run.
Risks:
- Telemetry volume increase; monitor Oona queue.
- Registry reset may affect existing seeds; plan migration.

Status:
- âœ… Completed 2025-09-28 â€” Command verifier telemetry emits CRITICAL `command_rejected` events with metrics, nonce ledger cleanup/counters are exposed (TTL/evictions), administrative resets clear registry + ledger state, and Kasmina telemetry/tests cover failure/success paths. Prefetch/cache reliability continues under WP-K4.

### WP-K4 â€” Prefetch & Cache Reliability
Tasks:
1. Require real `training_run_id`; remove `prototype` fallback (already enforced via dependency guard) and thread the ID through telemetry/metrics.
2. Run prefetch publish/consume loops on the shared `AsyncWorker`, track outstanding requests, and cancel on shutdown/deadline expiry. Surface CRITICAL `prefetch_timeout` telemetry with request metadata.
3. Add per-blueprint locking (or equivalent single-writer enforcement) around GPU/cache attachments to eliminate concurrent mutation; emit contention metrics/events when waits exceed thresholds.
4. Emit `kasmina.prefetch.requests_total`, `kasmina.prefetch.inflight`, `kasmina.prefetch.latency_ms`, and extend cache telemetry with lock-wait metrics so operators can observe prefetch health.
Acceptance:
- Prefetch integration tests demonstrate cancellation/timeouts without hanging the worker; coordinator shutdown returns cleanly.
- Cache telemetry reports lock-wait metrics and hit/miss counters without races; unit tests cover contention scenarios.
Risks:
- Async changes must align with Tolaria/Tamiyo worker.
- Additional locks may impact throughput; benchmark.

Status:
- ðŸš§ In Progress â€” Shared async worker integration, timeout/telemetry metrics, cache locking, and administrative resets implemented. Remaining actions: finalize observability/benchmark documentation and incorporate the integration test slice into the validation plan.

## Testing
- Unit: `pytest tests/kasmina` (seed manager, blending, dispatcher, prewarm suites), `radon cc -s src/esper/kasmina/seed_manager.py` (complexity snapshot).
- Integration: `pytest tests/integration/test_control_loop.py` (round trip, Kasmina telemetry uniqueness).
- Performance: Prefetch/cache benchmarks deferred alongside WP-K4.

## Rollback Plan
- Guard new fallback behaviour behind config until validated.
- Keep existing prefetch path available during staged rollout.

## Telemetry Verification
- `kasmina.gate_failure`, `kasmina.command_rejected`, blend telemetry, cache metrics verify.
- Emergency telemetry routes via Weatherlight per shared foundations.

## Sign-off
- WP-K1/WP-K2 complete (dispatcher, strict failures, blend telemetry); WP-K3/WP-K4 remain open items for telemetry/registry and prefetch/cache reliability in subsequent phases.
- `CHANGELOG_RC1.md` updated with Kasmina R4c entry summarising strict-dependency enforcement, async worker fix, and test coverage.
