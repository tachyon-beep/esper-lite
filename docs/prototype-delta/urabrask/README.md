# Urabrask — Prototype Delta (Out of Scope for Esper‑Lite)

Lead note: The intended scope for the Esper‑Lite prototype does not include Urabrask. The following is a minimal placeholder acknowledging the full design exists (`docs/design/detailed_design/07-urabrask-unified-design.md` and `07.1`/`07.2`), but no implementation is planned for this prototype.

Summary (design reference only): Urabrask provides safety validation and performance benchmarking harnesses integrated with the full Esper stack. In Esper‑Lite, those responsibilities are explicitly trimmed, with safety hooks embedded in Kasmina/Tolaria/Tamiyo and test harnesses standing in for Urabrask.

Status: Not applicable for the prototype; no code artefacts in `src/`.
