# Emrakul — Prototype Delta (Out of Scope for Esper‑Lite)

Lead note: The intended scope for the Esper‑Lite prototype does not include Emrakul. This is a placeholder acknowledging the full design (`docs/design/detailed_design/12-emrakul-unified-design.md`), but no implementation is planned for this prototype.

Summary (design reference only): Emrakul covers system‑wide orchestration strategies beyond the scope of the lite build. Any needed aspects are intentionally absorbed by the trimmed subsystems (e.g., Tolaria orchestration and Nissa observability).

Status: Not applicable for the prototype; no code artefacts in `src/`.
