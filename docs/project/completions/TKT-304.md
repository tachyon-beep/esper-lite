# TKT-304: Breaker & Rollback Drills â€” Completion Certificate

- Status: Verified
- Summary: Drill helpers raise/clear alerts for latency, isolation, queue depth, and Tezzeret retries; automated tests assert notification routing and operator docs capture recovery steps.
- Evidence:
  - Drill scripts: `src/esper/nissa/drills.py:27` (latency spike with alert clear) and `src/esper/nissa/drills.py:56` (Oona queue spike) plus `src/esper/nissa/drills.py:66` (Tezzeret retry burst).
  - Tests: `tests/nissa/test_drills.py:23` (drills drive alerts + summary) and `tests/nissa/test_observability.py:156` (alert routing expectations).
  - Runbook references: `docs/project/operator_runbook.md:42` (breaker flows, rollback cadence) and `docs/project/observability_runbook.md:38` (alert triage steps).
