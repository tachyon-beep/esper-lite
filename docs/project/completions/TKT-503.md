# TKT-503: Performance Profiling Harness — Completion Certificate

- Status: Partially Verified
- Summary: Tolaria profiling script and guide exist; telemetry exposes latency metrics. Dashboard tie-ins are documented; automated gating not wired in CI.
- Evidence:
  - Profiling script: `scripts/profile_tolaria.py:1` (PyTorch profiler, chrome trace output support, JSON summary).
  - Profiling guide: `docs/project/profiling.md:5` (workflow, trace instructions, Grafana overlays).
  - Telemetry metrics: `src/esper/tolaria/trainer.py:138` (epoch hook latency, telemetry emission) exercised in `tests/integration/test_control_loop.py:42`.
  - CI perf markers remain opt-in: `.github/workflows/ci.yml:52` (performance marker excluded) and `tests/leyline/test_serialization.py:186` (guarded by `ESPER_RUN_PERF_TESTS`).
- Notes:
  - To reach “complete”, consider adding a smoke profiling job in CI nightly and exporting trace artifacts.
