# TKT-001: Repository & CI Scaffold â€” Completion Certificate

- Status: Verified
- Summary: Esper-Lite ships with a consistent package layout, pinned toolchain, and CI matrix that mirrors the documented development workflow.
- Evidence:
  - Package surface and version export: `src/esper/__init__.py:1` (public subsystem list, semantic version).
  - Tooling and dependency pinning: `pyproject.toml:5` (3.11 floor, dev extras for pytest/ruff/mypy, publisher config).
  - CI matrix mirroring local commands: `.github/workflows/ci.yml:8` (lint/type job plus unit, integration, contract, serialization suites with Redis service).
  - Developer bootstrap + infra notes: `README.md:5` (venv creation, quality gates, local infrastructure scripts, observability stack instructions).
