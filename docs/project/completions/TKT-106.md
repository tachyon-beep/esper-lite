# TKT-106: Control Loop Integration Test Harness â€” Completion Certificate

- Status: Verified
- Summary: End-to-end integration exercises Tolaria, Tamiyo, Kasmina, and Oona ensuring telemetry budgets, seed state export, and stream delivery remain intact.
- Evidence:
  - Integration test: `tests/integration/test_control_loop.py:26` (epoch run, command propagation, metrics/events, backlog checks) and `tests/integration/test_control_loop.py:74` (Kasmina seed-state export via Tolaria completion packet).
  - Trainer hooks: `src/esper/tolaria/trainer.py:106` (run loop + telemetry) and `src/esper/tolaria/trainer.py:209` (publish_history async helper).
  - Oona stream usage: `src/esper/oona/messaging.py:83` (publish_state/telemetry) leveraged directly in the integration harness.
