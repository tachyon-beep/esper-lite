# TKT-104: Oona Control Loop Integration â€” Completion Certificate

- Status: Verified
- Summary: Control-loop subsystems exchange state, commands, telemetry, field reports, and policy updates over Redis Streams with consumer groups, emergency rerouting, and settings-backed stream names.
- Evidence:
  - Client capabilities: `src/esper/oona/messaging.py:83` (publish_state/telemetry/policy), `src/esper/oona/messaging.py:117` (consume with signature verification), and `src/esper/oona/messaging.py:242` (reroute/drop thresholds).
  - Settings plumbing: `src/esper/core/config.py:24` (Redis URL + Oona stream names) with defaults mirrored in `.env.example:8`.
  - Integration test: `tests/integration/test_control_loop.py:26` (Tolaria run publishes to Oona, backlog drains, telemetry round-trip verified).
