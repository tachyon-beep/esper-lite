# TKT-502: CI Test Matrix â€” Completion Certificate

- Status: Verified
- Summary: GitHub Actions pipeline runs lint/type gates and parallel pytest suites (unit, integration with Redis, contract, serialization) mirroring local workflow.
- Evidence:
  - Workflow definition: `.github/workflows/ci.yml:8` (quality job for ruff/pylint/mypy) and `.github/workflows/ci.yml:39` (matrix jobs for unit/integration/contract/serialization, Redis service).
  - Test layout: `tests/` tree contains subsystem suites (`tests/tolaria/test_tolaria_trainer.py:1`, `tests/tamiyo/test_service.py:1`, `tests/oona/test_messaging.py:1`, `tests/simic/test_trainer.py:1`, etc.), ensuring CI coverage matches design slices.
