# TKT-105: Tamiyo Field Report Stub â€” Completion Certificate

- Status: Verified
- Summary: Tamiyo assembles FieldReports aligned with Leyline, appends them to a WAL with retention, and publishes reports/telemetry through Oona for downstream Simic ingestion.
- Evidence:
  - Report creation: `src/esper/tamiyo/service.py:218` (generate_field_report with metrics delta + policy version) and `src/esper/tamiyo/service.py:278` (publish_history streaming reports + telemetry to Oona).
  - Persistence: `src/esper/tamiyo/persistence.py:24` (FieldReportStore config) and `src/esper/tamiyo/persistence.py:54` (append with fsync + retention enforcement).
  - Oona publication helper: `src/esper/oona/messaging.py:134` (publish_field_report entry).
  - Tests: `tests/tamiyo/test_persistence.py:23` (reload + retention) and `tests/tamiyo/test_service.py:57` (field report generation + publish history asynchronous flow).
